<h3>THE GOOD OLD HYMNS</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>There&rsquo;s lots of music in &rsquo;em, the hymns of long ago;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>An&rsquo; when some gray-haired brother sings the ones I used to know</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>I sorter want to take a hand&mdash;I think o&rsquo; days gone by&mdash;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>&ldquo;On Jordan&rsquo;s stormy banks I stand and cast a wishful eye.&rdquo;</i></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>There&rsquo;s lots of music in &rsquo;em&mdash;those dear, sweet hymns of old,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>With visions bright of lands of light and shining streets of gold;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>And I hear &rsquo;em ringing&mdash;singing, where memory dreaming stands,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>&ldquo;From Greenland&rsquo;s icy mountains to India&rsquo;s coral strands.&rdquo;</i></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>We hardly needed singin&rsquo; books in them old days: we knew</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>The words, the tunes, of every one, the dear old hymn book through!</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>We had no blaring trumpets then, no organs built for show;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>We only sang to praise the Lord, &ldquo;from whom all blessings flow.&rdquo;</i></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>An&rsquo; so I love the dear old hymns, and when my time shall come&mdash;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Before the light has left me and my singing lips are dumb&mdash;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>If I can only hear &rsquo;em then, I&rsquo;ll pass, without a sigh,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>&ldquo;To Canaan&rsquo;s fair and happy land, where my possessions lie!&rdquo;</i></p>

<h2 class="center" id="c1"><span class="h2line1">PREFACE</span></h2>
<p>Half a million hymns, it is estimated, are written
in more than two hundred languages and dialects
in which Christianity is preached. Some of
these are translations, but many are original expressions
of the Christian faith. This extraordinary
production is an impressive testimony from
Christian experience.</p>
<p>Having for many years made a study of the
influence of hymns in human experience, I have
during that time gleaned material from newspapers,
periodicals (both American and British)
and books; and to both the authors and the publishers
of these I here express my indebtedness.
Little is said in this volume concerning the origin
of hymns and tunes, or of their place in literature.
These aspects of the subject are well discussed in
&ldquo;The English Hymn&rdquo; by Louis F. Benson, &ldquo;The
Hymn as Literature&rdquo; by J. B. Reeves, &ldquo;The Story
of the Hymns and Tunes&rdquo; by T. Brown and H.
Butterworth, &ldquo;The Evolution of the English
Hymn&rdquo; by F. J. Gillman, &ldquo;Stories of Great
<span class="pb" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
Hymns of the Church&rdquo; by Silas H. Paine, &ldquo;English
Hymns: Their Authors and History&rdquo; by S.
W. Duffield, and many others.</p>
<p>The chief purpose of this volume is to show
how hymns have been actually used, and how
people have been helped by them in different circumstances
of life. Each chapter has a brief introduction
bearing on the special topic, and the
various incidents are linked together in a manner
which gives continuity to the whole.</p>
<p>Some of this material was used in addresses
at church services, and also in Chapel Addresses
at the Northern New York Summer School for
Ministerial Training. As dean of this school the
author desires to associate both the members of
the faculty and the student body with this volume.
Their expressed appreciation of the incidents
which they heard, and their urgent request for
the publication of the same, encouraged me to
complete this work.</p>
<p>I desire to make special mention of the assistance
received from the Rev. Oscar L. Joseph,
Litt. D. His wise counsel has been invaluable.
Furthermore, he has edited the volume with
the utmost care, and its final form is the result
of his experience as an author and his painstaking
labors. The introductory notes in each chapter
<span class="pb" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
were also written by Dr. Joseph and these constitute
an important feature of the volume.</p>
<p>Ministers and laity alike, it is believed, will
find this book of value. My hope is that it may
help towards a renewed emphasis upon the value
of Christian experience, and a broader recognition
of the rich heritage which Christianity has
in its songs.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER I</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>A Singing Faith</i></span></h2>
<p>Christianity came to the world on the wings of
song. From that memorable night when the angels
celebrated the divine grace in &ldquo;Glory to God in the
Highest&rdquo; up to the present day, song has been a
powerful agency in spreading the Gospel of Redemption.
Consider the influence of hymns in leading
people to God, in giving courage to the depressed,
hope to the disappointed, comfort to the
sorrowing, guidance to the perplexed; in creating
and confirming faith; in inspiring for the performance
of duty and for steadfastness in fidelity.</p>
<p>The hymn holds a premier place in the literature
of poetry, but it is much more than poetry. &ldquo;It belongs
with the things of the spirit, in the sphere of
religious experience and communion with God.&rdquo;
Some of the best hymns which have touched and
transformed the depths of human life may not
meet the tests of literary critics. But more important
than such academic standards is the conclusive
proof that these writings have animated and sustained
faith, hope and love. They have done this
more effectively than any other means employed
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
to produce these exhilarating and virtuous qualities
of Christian character.</p>
<p>It is true that Christianity came out of a religion
which has its rich heritage in the Psalter. Indeed,
this is the world&rsquo;s greatest hymn book; its sentences
of prayer and praise have captured the hearts of
generations of pious souls and ministered to their
religious and moral needs. It is equally true that
Christianity has liberated song far more effectively
than any other religion. Of all the liturgical aids to
private and public worship hymns are the most
popular because of their freedom from any sectarian
note and their wholesome ability to rouse
emotion and direct life in ways of humane service.</p>
<p>This chapter is a selection of incidents which
illustrate how hymns have voiced the deep instincts
of the soul under a variety of circumstances.
They witness to the power of the Gospel to soothe,
calm and sustain in ways hardly otherwise possible.
They show how hymns are woven into the fabric
of life and that in times of pressure they express
the latent and active emotions which give evidence
of the real worth and dignity of human personality.</p>
<p class="tb">Tastes differ about hymns, but many will agree
with these two men concerning:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<h3><span class="sc">The Supreme Hymn</span></h3>
<p>Emerson and Oliver Wendell Holmes were
once discussing what they considered the best hymn
ever written. Holmes said that the hymns published
by the various churches were mere bits of
cabinet-work&mdash;phrases from the Scriptures or from
devotional writers such as Thomas &agrave; Kempis being
patched together in metrical form. Emerson signified
his assent; and then Holmes, rising, continued,
&ldquo;In my opinion the greatest hymn ever written
is this:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Thou hidden love of God, whose height,</p>
<p class="t">Whose depth unfathomed, no man knows,</p>
<p class="t0">I see from far Thy beauteous light,</p>
<p class="t">Inly I sigh for Thy repose:</p>
<p class="t0">My heart is pained, nor can it be</p>
<p class="t0">At rest, till it finds rest in Thee.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know!&rdquo; exclaimed Emerson. &ldquo;That
is the supreme hymn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Its author was Gerhard Tersteegen, one of the
most prolific of German hymn writers. It was translated
by John Wesley when he was in Savannah,
Georgia, in 1736. It must have made a profound
impression upon Holmes who wrote the hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Lord of all being, throned afar,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy glory flames from sun and star;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p class="t0">Center and soul of every sphere,</p>
<p class="t0">Yet to each loving heart how near!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Harry Lauder, in <i>Roamin&rsquo; in the Gloamin&rsquo;</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> refers
to it as &ldquo;that gorgeous bit of poetic imagery,&rdquo;
and adds that Holmes would have been the greatest
hymn writer in the world had he only written
some more.</p>
<p class="tb">The reference to John Wesley recalls an interesting
incident:</p>
<h3><span class="sc">When Two Hymn-Writers Met</span></h3>
<p>On a fine summer&rsquo;s day in the first half of the
eighteenth century a traveler on horseback, crossing
one of the lovely hills of Derbyshire in England,
was aroused from his meditations by the voice of
singing. Pausing to listen, these words came on the
still air from the valley below:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Could we but climb where Moses stood,</p>
<p class="t">And view the landscape o&rsquo;er,</p>
<p class="t0">Not Jordan&rsquo;s stream, nor death&rsquo;s cold flood,</p>
<p class="t">Should fright us from the shore.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Instantly, in a clear voice, the traveler sent ringing
down the hills the glad response in his brother&rsquo;s
words:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The promised land, from Pisgah&rsquo;s top,</p>
<p class="t">I now exult to see:</p>
<p class="t0">My hope is full, O glorious hope!</p>
<p class="t">Of immortality.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And then the two greatest little men in all England,
John Wesley and Isaac Watts, met and talked
together of the deep things of God.</p>
<p>How indebted we are to these two men for the
enrichment of English hymnody! Watts sang of
the majesty of God while Charles Wesley, the
brother of the founder of Methodism, magnified
the love of God, but all three were one in purpose.
We join with Watts in singing, &ldquo;Jesus shall reign
where&rsquo;er the sun,&rdquo; and with the same enthusiasm
we sing with Charles Wesley, &ldquo;Jesus, Lover of
My Soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">How profoundly Watts had influenced his contemporaries
is seen in</p>
<h3><span class="sc">John Wesley&rsquo;s Last Hymn</span></h3>
<p>The great evangelist had reached the age of
eighty-eight and his passing hence was in a cloud
of glory. Arnold Lunn thus describes it in his book
<i>John Wesley</i>:<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> &ldquo;The end was very beautiful. He
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
lingered for three days, surrounded by those who
loved him. No pain, only a growing sense of weakness,
and a tranquil acceptance of the inevitable.
He slept much and spoke little, but sometimes the
dying flame flickered up, and the inner light which
had changed the face of England glowed with its
old intensity. On the afternoon before he died, he
surprised his friends by bursting into song:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll praise my Maker while I&rsquo;ve breath,</p>
<p class="t0">And when my voice is lost in death,</p>
<p class="t0">Praise shall employ my nobler powers.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>He sang two verses and then sank back exhausted.
These lines were from Watts&rsquo; well-known hymn.
Some hours passed as Wesley continued to sink,
and with ebbing strength his last words of triumphant
faith were: &ldquo;The best of all is, God is
with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Such a consciousness of the divine presence has
sustained many others. Here is one instance entitled:</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Singing Their Farewell</span></h3>
<p>Having spent forty years in educational work
in England, a Scotch schoolmaster and his wife
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
moved back to their native land to spend their days
of retirement. Since they were active in one of the
local churches, the membership came together for
a farewell service. When they came to sing the
closing hymn, choice was made of an arrangement
of Psalm 34.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> Doubtless the aged couple going
into the sunset period of life afterwards recalled
the words which they and their friends in Christian
service sang that evening:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Through all the changing scenes of life,</p>
<p class="t">In trouble and in joy,</p>
<p class="t0">The praises of my God shall still</p>
<p class="t">My heart and tongue employ.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">. . . <span class="hst">. . .</span> <span class="hst">. . .</span></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Fear Him, ye saints, and you will then</p>
<p class="t">Have nothing else to fear;</p>
<p class="t0">Make you His service your delight,</p>
<p class="t">He&rsquo;ll make your wants His care.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Cheerful and encouraging words were these in
which to voice a farewell.</p>
<p class="tb">The happy outlook of a faith which breaks out
in song impressed me when I was a patient</p>
<h3><span class="sc">In the Hospital</span></h3>
<p>Christmas was near, and I was a patient in a hospital
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
away from home. The attending physician
informed me that Dr. William D. Marsh, the
founder of &ldquo;The League of the Kindly Tongue,&rdquo;
an organization which has a large membership in
the United States as well as in some other countries,
was in the same hospital on the floor below.
The day he was discharged, he came to visit me.
During the conversation he stated that he had
recently been relearning and trying to live a hymn
which he found very precious. It was one of Toplady&rsquo;s:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;If, on a quiet sea,</p>
<p class="t">Toward heaven we calmly sail,</p>
<p class="t0">With grateful hearts, O God, to Thee,</p>
<p class="t">We&rsquo;ll own the favoring gale.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Special reference was made to the last verse:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Teach us, in every state,</p>
<p class="t">To make Thy will our own;</p>
<p class="t0">And when the joys of sense depart,</p>
<p class="t">To live by faith alone.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Such was the hymn beloved by the man who endeavored
to enlist men and women to bring their
daily conversation into harmony with the Golden
Rule.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p class="tb">This experience brought to my mind the gracious
sufficiency of Him whom every believer confesses
as</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Sun of My Soul</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Years of constructive service were given by Dr.
Charles N. Sims to the important task of building
up Syracuse University. It was during the time of
the early struggles of the development of that
institution that he served heroically as the Chancellor.
Later there followed some years of pulpit
activity. Then came the time of retirement from
educational and pastoral leadership, and he returned
to his native state of Indiana to spend the
eventide of life.</p>
<p>When it was evident that the time of his home-going
was near, a member of the family went to
the piano and played the hymn he greatly loved.
Softly also it was sung:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Sun of my soul, thou Saviour dear,</p>
<p class="t0">It is not night if Thou be near.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The second stanza was reached:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;When the soft dews of kindly sleep</p>
<p class="t0">My wearied eyelids gently steep,</p>
<p class="t0">Be my last thought, how sweet to rest</p>
<p class="t0">Forever on my Saviour&rsquo;s breast.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Relatives, looking on the peaceful form, then
observed that he had quietly answered the call of
his Lord, and that the spirit had gone to the home
of many mansions.</p>
<p class="tb">Here is an incident which recalls one of the bitter
tragedies of the ocean. See also <a href="#Page_30">page 30</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Their Last Sing-Song</span></h3>
<p>Permission was obtained from the purser of the
<i>Titanic</i> to hold a song service in the saloon one
Sunday evening. The Rev. E. C. Carter, of Whitechapel,
London, a clergyman of the Anglican
Church, was in charge. A young Scotch engineer
presided at the piano.</p>
<p>The passengers were asked to make their selections.
It was significant that many of the hymns
chosen had to do with dangers at sea. There was a
hushed tone with which all sang: &ldquo;For those in
peril on the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The service lasted until after ten o&rsquo;clock, with
wishes exchanged by all that they might soon reach
the end of their pleasant voyage by landing in
New York. Little did they realize at the time that
only a few miles ahead lay one peril on the sea in
the iceberg that sank the great liner. The leader of
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
this service and his wife were among the hundreds
who perished ere the dawn of the next day.</p>
<p class="tb">The power of hymns to calm and sustain is seen in</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Other Refuge Have I None</span></h3>
<p>An air raid of the enemy threatened the destruction
of a munitions factory &ldquo;somewhere in England&rdquo;
where thousands of women were working,
according to Mrs. Burnett Smith. A very tense
feeling prevailed, for it was realized that the worst
might happen at any moment. Nerves began to
break a little, while sobs and screams were being
heard. Then some one in a far corner began softly
to sing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Jesus, Lover of my soul,</p>
<p class="t0">Let me to Thy bosom fly.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The others quickly joined in the song until all
were singing softly and quietly. The danger passed,
and the women were unharmed.</p>
<p>One can imagine the courage of that group of
women rising as they prayerfully sang the words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Other refuge have I none;</p>
<p class="t">Hangs my helpless soul on Thee:</p>
<p class="t0">Leave, ah! leave me not alone,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p class="t">Still support and comfort me:</p>
<p class="t0">All my trust on Thee is stayed,</p>
<p class="t">All my help from Thee I bring;</p>
<p class="t0">Cover my defenseless head</p>
<p class="t">With the shadow of Thy wing.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">Their help in giving the fortitude of faith is
illustrated by</p>
<h3><span class="sc">An Unforgotten Song</span></h3>
<p>A British writer has told us of an evening which
he spent at a fashionable watering place in Scotland.
The visitors were seated in the drawing-room,
spending the evening in a leisurely manner
in reading or conversing.</p>
<p>Presently two ladies walked up to the piano, one
to sing, the other to play her accompaniment. Conversation
still continued, as the air was played
over. But as soon as the words were reached, a hush
fell upon the audience. The piece was Topliff&rsquo;s setting
of &ldquo;Remember now thy Creator in the days
of thy youth.&rdquo; The drawing-room was a large one,
capable of seating some hundreds of people, and
furnished in a way calculated to deaden sound. Yet
every word was heard distinctly.</p>
<p>The man who tells the story says that next to
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
him was sitting a man, apparently from the west of
England, &ldquo;endowed with a wise and gracious
Christlike spirit, the fruit of many years&rsquo; experience
in his Master&rsquo;s service.&rdquo; This man listened
with rapt attention. Then he turned to his neighbor,
and whispered in a hushed voice, &ldquo;I can tell
by the way that girl sings that she is a Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The narrator of the incident, anxious to know
more about the young lady, learned something of
her experience. He records it as follows: &ldquo;She had
been engaged to be married to a medical man&mdash;a
very fine Christian. One day, when he was staying
at a place far distant from the home of his fianc&eacute;e,
he was suddenly stricken with typhoid fever, and
died almost immediately. The lady was not told
about it till after the funeral was over. The shock
was so great that she was prostrated for some days.
When she was able to get about again, her lovely
voice, her greatest gift, was gone. Something like
paralysis of the throat prevented her speaking
above a whisper. Many months after, the voice
gradually came back. When she was able to sing
once more with her old power, she made a solemn
vow that she would devote her voice very specially
to God&rsquo;s service. Thenceforth her most treasured
possession was the Bible of her beloved. I saw it.
It was crowded with notes from cover to cover, for
the book was woven into its owner&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p class="tb">The secret of such a faith is finely expressed in</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Sounding the Silver Trumpet</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;I had read in the biography of Sir Edward
Burne-Jones a legend which he had noted,&rdquo; said
Dr. R. G. Gillie. &ldquo;When Lucifer was cast out of
the Holy City he founded a kingdom of his own,
and one of his retainers, greatly caring, asked what
he missed most now that he was shut out of
Heaven. Pondering, the Prince of Evil paused and
answered: &lsquo;I miss the sound of the silver trumpets
in the morning.&rsquo; According to the legend all the
glad populace was called each day to labor and
achievement by silver trumpets.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Today on weary nations</p>
<p class="t">The heavenly manna falls;</p>
<p class="t0">To holy convocations</p>
<p class="t">The silver trumpet calls.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">The response to this call is touchingly related
in an incident:</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Grandchildren of Cannibals Praised God</span></h3>
<p>Stirring reports were brought back from Africa
by Mr. W. J. W. Roome when he went there in
1929 for the British and Foreign Bible Society.
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
The main station of the great English Baptist Mission
on the Congo is at Yakusu. When Mr. Roome
arrived at this point the children of the mission,
who were the grandchildren of cannibals, greeted
him by singing Lyte&rsquo;s great hymn.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Praise, my soul, the King of Heaven;</p>
<p class="t0">To His feet thy tribute bring;</p>
<p class="t0">Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,</p>
<p class="t0">Who like me His praise should sing?</p>
<p class="t0">Praise Him! praise Him! praise Him! praise Him!</p>
<p class="t0">Praise the everlasting King!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">The irrepressible faith in missionary work was
recently advertised by</p>
<h3><span class="sc">A Song Which Belted the Globe</span></h3>
<p>Over four thousand women attended a communion
service in Columbus, Ohio, October 30,
1929. It was held in connection with the sixtieth
anniversary of the Woman&rsquo;s Foreign Missionary
Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and
was thus described by Eloise Andrews Woolever in
<i>The Christian Advocate</i>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last great day opened with the communion
service at 6:45, conducted by Bishop William F.
McDowell. At 4:30 on that dark, rainy morning
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
eight hundred women were standing on the steps
of Memorial Hall. For nearly three hours the procession
passed forward to receive the broken bread
from the brass communion plates sent from Korea,
and to drink the wine from the Chinese communion
cups, and to stand a moment in prayer. And
in the solemn hush one thought of the communion
services being held around the world on this day,
when the communion song, &lsquo;The Light of the
World is Jesus,&rsquo; would belt the globe.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">This is the theme, announced with variations,
concerning</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Wondrous Story</span></h3>
<p>A company of friends were in the <i>Sunday School
Times</i> party which took a trip by water from Philadelphia
to the Pacific coast. In an article on &ldquo;Cruising
to California,&rdquo; in 1930, Dr. Charles G. Trumbull
related the following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were gathered together on the after-deck
of the steamer, singing the old hymns. Night had
come down over the ocean, the myriad stars of a
tropical sky were twinkling overhead, and more
than one of the Sunday School Times party who
were joining in the singing were thanking God for
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
the precious memories the old hymns brought
them. Stewards and stewardesses in the service of
the ship were on deck near by, resting in steamer
chairs, enjoying the cool breezes and listening to
the hymns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was interesting to note the deep interest with
which the passengers on board listened to the singing
of the old hymns. Some joined in; the lips of
others were seen moving as words of the hymn
were being repeated; one man removed his eyeglasses
to wipe a certain mistiness from his eyes,
then he rather timidly asked that a certain hymn
might be sung, &lsquo;I Will Sing the Wondrous Story.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Some incidents are parables of life as when a
congregation</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Sang Amid the Darkness</span></h3>
<p>Many years ago the Bishop of Ripon preached
at Harrowgate on the text, &ldquo;While ye have light,
believe in the light, that ye may be the children of
light&rdquo; (John 12:36). Earnestly and impressively
he presented Christ as the Light of the World.
Those away from Christ were pictured as being
out in the darkness. Tenderly urging the congregation
to come into the light, he announced the
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
hymn, &ldquo;Abide With Me!&rdquo; The large congregation
had joined with the choir in singing the first
line:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Abide with me! Fast falls the eventide,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>when every light in the church suddenly went out.</p>
<p>Without a moment of pause, however, the choir
continued to follow the organ, and sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The darkness deepens&mdash;Lord, with me abide!</p>
<p class="t0">When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,</p>
<p class="t0">Help of the helpless, O abide with me!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>While singing the next lines, a few of the gas
jets were lit. These words were:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Swift to its close ebbs out life&rsquo;s little day;</p>
<p class="t0">Earth&rsquo;s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>But the lights feebly flickered and died, and the
congregation, again in darkness, continued:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Change and decay in all around I see:</p>
<p class="t0">O Thou, who changest not, abide with me!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>But the choir sang on to the end. When they
reached the last stanza some of the gas jets were
burning; and in the dim light the words were stirringly
appealing:</p>

<p class="tb"><i>The Christian Advocate</i> gives two illustrations
of the popularity of the hymn,</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">God Will Take Care of You</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>A blind man was seen crossing the street at a
dangerous place in the Bronx, New York City.
When a friend approached he saw that the lips of
the blind man were moving, and as he listened he
heard him singing softly, &ldquo;God will take care of
you.&rdquo; When the friend made himself known to the
blind man he carelessly inquired, &ldquo;Why are you
singing that hymn?&rdquo; He replied: &ldquo;The reason is
that I must cross this dangerous crossing just ahead
of me in about a minute, and I was thinking that
possibly one of the many wagons or trucks might
strike me and I would get killed. But the thought
came to me that even if it did occur my soul would
go straight to God. And if He led me across all
right it would be just another evidence of His care
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
of me. So I just could not help singing to myself,
&lsquo;God will take care of you.&rsquo; Hallelujah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A young woman who had lost both her husband
and little daughter, and was left to support herself
in sorrow, took a slip of paper on which was written
the song, &ldquo;God will take care of you,&rdquo; and pinned
it over the place where she did her dishwashing,
and testified to the great comfort the song brought
to her.</p>
<p class="tb">A different kind of testimony, both interesting
and exceptional, is given in</p>
<h3><span class="sc">A Sexton&rsquo;s Tribute to a Singer</span></h3>
<p>Traveling amid the great artificial lakes in the
Elan Valley, from which Birmingham receives its
water supply from the Welsh mountains, the visitor
had pointed out to him by the driver a little
church on the hillside. The visitor was interested
in the &ldquo;little sanctuary, nestling among the green
mountains,&rdquo; and confessed that he liked to think
of places which recall the words, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quiet down
here... And God is very near.&rdquo; Being a newspaper
man, however, he was particularly impressed
by a somewhat garbled version of the time when
Dame Clara Butt sang in the little building. Later,
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
in London, he had the opportunity of hearing the
story from Dame Clara Butt herself. She was motoring
with some friends through the valley beyond
Llandrindod Wells and espied this simple and tiny
church, without spire or tower, standing alone on the
hillside. It seemed so like a little private sanctuary
that she exclaimed, &ldquo;I wish that little church were
mine!&rdquo; and halted the car, and crossed the river to
have a closer look.</p>
<p>It happened that a service was almost due, and
the sexton and an old companion were there; so the
visitors were able to enter the sanctuary. They remained
in silence a few minutes, when one of the
party, pointing to the little organ, asked Dame
Clara to play it and sing. She shook her head; the
request was repeated; the impulse came and the
singer sat at the instrument, and sang the opening
lines of Liddle&rsquo;s setting of &ldquo;Abide With Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes she was conscious that the old
sexton was chiming in with notes which harmonized;
but, as the great voice rang through the little
church, he stopped to listen, for nothing like it had
ever been heard there. When the last notes died
away, he said, &ldquo;But who is this lady who has sung
to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he was told he held up his hands, and
with tears falling, exclaimed, &ldquo;The great Madame
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
Clara Butt has come to our little church and sung
to us!&rdquo; Then pointing upward, he said reverently:
&ldquo;Ah! They heard that up there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This tribute, coming from the sexton who had
himself once sung in Welsh choirs, was all the
more gratifying because it was simple and spontaneous.</p>
<p class="tb">Here is an interesting sidelight upon</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Author of &ldquo;Beulah Land&rdquo;</span></h3>
<p>Edgar Page Stites, the author of &ldquo;Beulah Land&rdquo;
and many other popular hymns, was a local deacon
of the Methodist Episcopal Church and served as a
supply preacher in Dakota. At the outbreak of the
Civil War he lived in Richmond, Virginia. After
enlisting he was stationed in Philadelphia and had
charge of feeding the troops which passed through
that city. At the time of his death in Cape May he
was the oldest insurance agent in New Jersey.</p>
<p>During his retirement he once wrote to a friend:
&ldquo;I am whittling away on my eighty-second year.
Have written a great many songs the last fifty
years signed &lsquo;Edgar Page,&rsquo; which is the front of
my name. I was enabled by great spiritual help to
write &lsquo;Beulah Land&rsquo; in 1876, at Philadelphia. I
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
was wonderfully converted sixty-five years ago this
month [November, 1852] and am still on board
the old ship Zion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Joe&rdquo; Cannon, ex-Speaker of the House
of Representatives, once met Mr. Stites in Cape
May and told him he would rather have written
&ldquo;Beulah Land&rdquo; than to have been President of the
United States. Chaplain McCabe was the first to
introduce this now famous hymn to the public,
singing it at a ministers&rsquo; meeting in Philadelphia.
Since then it has been sung around the world and
during the World War it was a general favorite of
the soldiers overseas.</p>
<p class="tb">And another sidelight upon the writer of</p>
<h3><span class="sc">A Hymn of Consecration</span></h3>
<p>Miss Frances Ridley Havergal was visiting a
home in Cavendish Square, London, where the
aristocracy live. She was to be a guest for five days.
Knowing that several members of this family were
not rejoicing Christians, she made a prayer, &ldquo;Lord,
give me <i>all</i> in this house.&rdquo; The way was opened
through her singing and she entranced everyone in
this home. The father, mother, children and servants
were all brought clear into the Kingdom of
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
joy and peace before she left. On the last night
of her visit she was too happy to sleep, and spent
the greater portion of it in meditation and prayer.
Then it was that there came to her the hymn which
she wrote with buoyant feeling,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Take my life and let it be</p>
<p class="t0">Consecrated, Lord, to Thee,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>ending with the line, &ldquo;Ever, only, all for Thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The energy and endurance of this singing faith
come from the Holy Spirit. I quote a description
of a singular event in Heidelberg, Germany, written
for <i>The Christian Advocate</i> by Professor J.
Newton Davies. It might be called</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Kindling the Torches at the Bonfire</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;On a June evening, the student corporations of
the university, a thousand strong, assembled on the
banks of the Neckar to celebrate the coming of
summer. Each student carried in his hand an unlighted
torch. At a given signal, they marched,
singing, across the old bridge, and up the steep
path to the Bismarck tower, where a bonfire blazed.
At this bonfire each man lighted his torch, and then
continued his march to the valley below. The thousand
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
burning torches glinting through the dark fir
trees were an unforgettable sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Jerusalem, at Pentecost, the fires of a religious
enthusiasm were kindled, at the blaze of
which a small band of Christians lighted the unlit
torches of their personalities. With loins girt, and
lamps lit, that gallant group of torchbearers set
forth, singing songs of victory and triumph, to herald
the advent of a New Day. As we today, nineteen
centuries afterward, look back on their astonishing
victories, we cannot but fervently join in
Charles Wesley&rsquo;s prayer:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;O Thou, who camest from above,</p>
<p class="t">The pure celestial fire to impart,</p>
<p class="t0">Kindle a flame of sacred love</p>
<p class="t">On the mean altar of my heart!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">There let it for Thy glory burn,</p>
<p class="t">With inextinguishable blaze,</p>
<p class="t0">And trembling to its source return,</p>
<p class="t">In humble love and fervent praise.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb">One of the hymns which stirs our spirits for
valiant endeavor is</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Onward, Christian Soldiers</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>The Rev. S. Baring Gould was the author of one
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
hundred and forty books, showing versatility of
genius in these works of religion, fiction, folklore,
mythology, travel, biography, art. Many of these
writings will doubtless be forgotten when a hymn
which he improvised and wrote in great haste, as a
marching song for a band of schoolchildren in his
parish, will continue to be remembered. About this
hymn, &ldquo;Onward, Christian Soldiers,&rdquo; the author
once wrote, &ldquo;Certainly nothing has surprised me
more than its great popularity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The universal appeal of this hymn has justly made
it a heritage of Christian civilization. It belongs
to every church and nation and no one thinks of the
author as an Anglican rector but as a large-hearted
soul, which he truly was. It is sung by surpliced
choir boys in the incense-laden air of Roman Catholic
churches; and by lads without vestments in the
plain country church; by the Knights of Columbus
and by the Knights Templar; by Presbyterians,
Methodists, Baptists and every other denomination.
Indeed, it is used by all Christians as a rallying
call and it will so continue till the church militant
becomes the Church triumphant.</p>
<p class="tb">The romance of American history is impressively
illuminated by</p>

<h3><span class="sc">A Shrine Created by a Song</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a church in the valley by the wildwood&rdquo;&mdash;this
song has been sung for threescore
years and more in all the world. It has furthermore
made famous &ldquo;The Little Brown Church in
the Vale,&rdquo; located in the village of Nashua, Iowa.
The associations of this sanctuary go back to early
pioneer days when the settlers contributed lumber,
logs, stone and labor for its erection. Dr. W. S.
Pitts, a physician who had helped to build this
church, was inspired to write the song.</p>
<p>The railroad came in 1868 to Nashua and the
Little Brown Church began to thrive as the population
had now increased to about a thousand. Dr.
Pitts taught a singing school in Bradford, a few
miles away. It was necessary to have an organ but
the only instrument in all this region was in the
Little Brown Church. His song at once gained
popularity. Jubilee singers took it up and concert
companies carried it all over America and Europe.
It was even heard in New Zealand, Australia and
South America.</p>
<p>The song was then forgotten and with the drift
of the population away from the country the Little
Brown Church was abandoned. But about twenty-five
years ago the old song was revived and an
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
interest in the little church was quickened. It was
restored to its original condition, largely due to the
song it had inspired. Every year thousands of visitors
go to Nashua to see it. It has also become a sort
of Gretna Green, for over five hundred couples
have been married there. Indeed, the church is
largely supported by these fees and it continues to
do the work of a real country church. Seldom have
a church and a song been so closely identified as in
this instance.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Songs in the Night</i></span></h2>
<p>The quality of our faith is made known in times
of stress and storm, when appearances are anything
but favorable and the outlook is bleak and barren.
Just as the courage of the soldier is shown in the
thick of the battle rather than at the camp fires, so
the fortitude of the Christian is exhibited in the
strife and strain of untoward circumstances. These
may be caused by some calamity such as sickness or
death or some serious loss. The pessimist sees only
darkness and danger and is ready to let go. The
optimist sees only brightness and security but is
nonplused before mishaps. They are both one-sided
and superficial because they reckon with a
limited set of facts. The meliorist, on the other
hand, is convinced that, because his faith is fixed
trusting in God, he can weather the tempest and
survive the severe ordeal.</p>
<p>It has been said that many hymns are weakened
by excessive sentimentalism. This criticism carries
the point too far and overlooks the fact that in the
final analysis we are influenced far more by the
monitions of the heart than by the admonitions of
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
the head. What Dr. Joseph Collins calls &ldquo;adult
infantilism&rdquo; is due, according to this keen analyst,
to our failure to educate and regulate our emotions.
To be sure, there is such a thing as frothy emotionalism,
but when we go to the other extreme and
pretend we are living in an ice pack it is often due
to the inferiority complex. Better a sentimentalism
which stirs our emotions than a rationalism which
suppresses them.</p>
<p>The answer to this inept criticism is given in the
following incidents. They illustrate how men and
women have expressed the buoyancy of religion in
the darkness of peril, accident, sorrow, suffering
and other trials. It was their faith which made use
of hymns to carry on until the day dawned.</p>
<p class="tb">Here is an incident from a memorable tragedy
which tells how one</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Played a Hymn on the Deck of a Sinking Boat</span></h3>
<p class="center">&ldquo;Wallace H. Hartley
<br />Died April 15, 1912
<br />&lsquo;Nearer, my God, to Thee&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Such was the simple inscription on the rosewood
coffin of one of the heroic figures of the musical
realm, whose name was carried all over the world
when the <i>Titanic</i> was sunk. As the boats were hurrying
away from the wreck the marine band continued
to play until their instruments were choked
by the swirling water that closed about the musicians
and sent them to heroes&rsquo; graves. Of the eight
bandsmen six were Englishmen, one a German and
one a Frenchman.</p>
<p>Their leader was Mr. Wallace H. Hartley. One
who had been with him on twenty-two voyages on
the <i>Mauretania</i> states that he once casually asked
him what he would do if he were on a boat which
was wrecked. He promptly replied that he would
play &ldquo;Nearer, my God, to Thee.&rdquo; And this was the
hymn he led the bandsmen in playing after they
had long been rendering popular tunes, when he
had to make a last selection before the great ship
made her final plunge.</p>
<p>Among the 815 passengers and 688 crew who
were drowned was W. T. Stead, editor of <i>The
Review of Reviews</i>. A few years previous he had
published &ldquo;<i>Hymns That Have Helped</i>.&rdquo; In this
list of the best hundred hymns, &ldquo;Nearer, my God,
to Thee&rdquo; stands seventh. The Prince of Wales,
later King Edward VII, sent a letter to the editor
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
in which he expressed a preference for this hymn
and said, &ldquo;There is none more touching nor one
that goes more truly to the heart than No. 7 on
your list.&rdquo; Mr. Stead made the terse comment,
&ldquo;The hymn is as dear to the peasant as it is to the
prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. E. J. Elliott, president of the local musicians&rsquo;
union at Louisville, at the time of the disaster
said there is a standing rule in the national
organization requiring bands attending funerals of
dead members to conclude the rites with this tune.
&ldquo;That is the last thing we play at the grave of a
musician&mdash;&lsquo;Nearer, my God, to Thee.&rsquo; I believe
that, knowing they were doomed as the result of
their own heroism, the members of the ship&rsquo;s orchestra
thus commended their own souls to their
God, giving expression to their petition in the notes
of their instruments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a fitting expression for souls about to wing
their way into eternity!</p>
<p class="tb">Equally impressive is this incident when</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Rescuers Steered in the Direction Of the Singer</span></h3>
<p>When the English steamer <i>Stella</i> was wrecked on
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
the Casquet rocks twelve women were put into a
boat which the waves whirled away, leaving them
helpless without even an oar. They passed a terrific
night not knowing what awaited them. Wet
and cold they would have perished but for the
courage of one of them, Miss Marguerite Williams,
who was a contralto singer.</p>
<p>There was no thought of ruining her voice at
such a crisis, and through the night she sang parts
from &ldquo;The Messiah&rdquo; and &ldquo;Elijah&rdquo; and also hymns.
This cheered the desolate women. About four
o&rsquo;clock in the morning a lifeboat which was sent out
to save any surviving victims came to a pause in the
waters as the men heard a woman&rsquo;s voice singing
in the distance. The words, &ldquo;Oh! rest in the Lord,&rdquo;
were carried to them by the wind and they promptly
steered in their direction. Before long they
sighted the boat with the twelve women who were
taken aboard the steam launch.</p>
<p>The singing of Miss Williams not only braced
up her companions and herself but led to their
rescue.</p>
<p class="tb">Dr. W. T. Grenfell recounts a rescue under similar
circumstances in his book<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> entitled</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Adrift on an Ice-Pan</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>He had returned home on Easter Sunday after
the service when he received an urgent call to go
sixty miles to help a young man on whom he had
previously operated. Crossing the ice the next day,
as it was breaking up, he found that he was on a
piece which was drifting into the open Atlantic.
Three of his dogs were killed, and from their
bones he made a flagpole; while their coats were
used to keep him warm during the night.</p>
<p>All night long he drifted, but was rescued in the
morning, although there seemed little probability
that he would be. Through the night, expecting
death at any moment, there ran through his mind
the words of an old hymn which came back to him
from his boyhood days:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;My God, my Father, while I stray</p>
<p class="t0">Far from my home, on life&rsquo;s rough way,</p>
<p class="t0">O teach me from my heart to say,</p>
<p class="t4">Thy will be done!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Referring to this rescue, Dr. Grenfell said: &ldquo;As
I went to sleep that first night there still rang in
my ears the same verse of the old hymn which had
been my companion on the ice, &lsquo;Thy will, not mine,
O Lord.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p class="tb">There is much significance in a ceremony associated
with</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Dedicating a Lifeboat</span></h3>
<p>Five hundred lives had been saved by a lifeboat
service at the Scilly Islands just off the coast of
Cornwall, England, between 1828 and 1930. These
islands are near the main lines of Atlantic travel.</p>
<p>A new lifeboat costing $42,500 was dedicated
in August, 1930. It was named the <i>Cunard</i> in honor
of the donors, the Cunard Steamship Company.
This boat is fitted with twin screws and two engines,
each of forty horsepower, which could work even
though the engine room were filled with water.
She has water-tight compartments, generates her
own electricity and is manned by a crew of eight men.</p>
<p>Two prayers were offered by ministers, and two
hymns were sung. Led by the local band, the
assembled company, who fully realized the perils
of the great waters, joined in singing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Eternal Father, strong to save,</p>
<p class="t0">Whose arm hath bound the restless wave,</p>
<p class="t0">Who bidds&rsquo;t the mighty ocean deep,</p>
<p class="t0">Its own appointed limits keep;</p>
<p class="t0">O hear us when we cry to Thee</p>
<p class="t0">For those in peril on the sea.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O Christ, whose voice the waters heard</p>
<p class="t0">And hushed their raging at Thy word,</p>
<p class="t0">Who walkedst on the foaming deep,</p>
<p class="t0">And calm amid the storm didst sleep;</p>
<p class="t0">O hear us when we cry to Thee</p>
<p class="t0">For those in peril on the sea.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Equally appropriate was the second hymn
rendered:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O God, our help in ages past,</p>
<p class="t">Our hope for years to come,</p>
<p class="t0">Our shelter from the stormy blast,</p>
<p class="t">And our eternal home!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">The confidence of such faith is illustrated in</p>
<h3><span class="sc">What Led to &ldquo;He Leadeth Me&rdquo;</span></h3>
<p>The birthplace of this world-renowned hymn
was marked in Philadelphia by a tablet containing
the first stanza and the following inscription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He Leadeth Me,&rsquo; sung throughout
the world, was written by the Rev. Dr.
Joseph H. Gilmore, a son of a Governor
of New Hampshire, in the home of
Deacon Wattson, immediately after
preaching in the First Baptist Church,
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
northwest corner Broad and Arch Streets,
on the 26th day of March, 1862. The
church and Deacon Wattson&rsquo;s house stood
on the ground on which this building is
erected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The United Gas Improvement Company,
in recognition of the beauty and
fame of the hymn, and in remembrance
of its distinguished author, makes this
permanent record on the first day of
June, 1926.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The subject of the sermon was the Twenty-third
Psalm, especially the words &ldquo;He leadeth me.&rdquo;
After the service a few met with the minister and
rehearsed the impression, emphasizing the timeliness
of the sermon, since this was the darkest hour
of the War of Rebellion. &ldquo;Then and there,&rdquo; wrote
Dr. Gilmore, &ldquo;on a blank page of the brief from
which I had intended to speak, I penciled the
hymn, handed it to my wife, and thought no more
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was later published in a Boston paper, which
attracted the attention of William B. Bradbury,
who set the hymn to music. Since then it has gone
on its mission, translated into several languages
and sung by people of different churches. Bishop
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
Paddock had it included in the revised hymnal of
the Protestant Episcopal Church, saying &ldquo;how
could I conduct a service in a home for the aged if
I couldn&rsquo;t give out &lsquo;He Leadeth Me&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This hymn was once sung in a Chinese court of
justice by a native who had never seen a white missionary,
to show the presiding judge what a Christian
hymn was like. The man was being tried for
renting a building to some Christians who had
opened an opium refuge. When he told the justice
that at their meetings the Christians prayed and
sang hymns, he was asked for a specimen and sang
&ldquo;He Leadeth Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">How a crisis was averted is seen when</p>
<h3><span class="sc">A German Girl Led in Singing &ldquo;A Mighty Fortress&rdquo;</span></h3>
<p>A few years ago there was a fearful accident at
the coal mines near Scranton, Pennsylvania. Several
men were buried for three days and all hopes
of their rescue seemed to be futile. Most of the
miners in this region were Germans. Their excitement
was intensified by sympathy for the wives and
children of the buried men and their failure to rescue
them.</p>
<p>On the third day at evening, a mob assembled at
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
the mouth of the mine in a sullen temper because
it was hopeless to dig further since the men were
probably dead by this time, and in their mad rage
they blamed the rich mine owners for the tragedy.
They were ready for any violence if only some
reckless word was spoken.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was tense but it was suddenly
changed when a little German girl, about eleven
years of age, pale with fear, lifted her voice in
song. She began in a hoarse whisper but her childish
voice gathered strength as she went on with the
first verse of Luther&rsquo;s hymn, &ldquo;A Mighty Fortress
Is Our God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence as these lines fell on the ears
of the Germans, familiar with them from the
cradle. Others joined and before long the whole
company were singing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Did we in our own strength confide,</p>
<p class="t">Our striving would be losing;</p>
<p class="t0">Were not the right Man on our side,</p>
<p class="t">The Man of God&rsquo;s own choosing.</p>
<p class="t0">Doth ask who that may be?</p>
<p class="t0">Christ Jesus, it is He;</p>
<p class="t0">Lord Sabaoth is His name,</p>
<p class="t0">From age to age the same,</p>
<p class="t">And He must win the battle.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>The tide was turned and, encouraged, they resumed
their work and kept at it. Before morning
the joyful news came up from the pit that the men
were found and that they were alive. What a word
in season was this girl&rsquo;s hymn!</p>
<p class="tb">Here is a touching story about</p>
<h3><span class="sc">What a Blind Soldier Wanted to Hear</span></h3>
<p>When a Salvation Army officer was conducting
a song service in the wards of the hospital at Bazeilles,
France, where there were many wounded
American soldiers during the World War, a blind
lad asked them to sing something for him. The
choice was appropriate and pathetic as he expressed
a desire to hear the old hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Lead, kindly light, amid the encircling gloom,</p>
<p class="t7">Lead Thou me on!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>One can easily imagine that the words prayerfully
expressed the deepest desire of his soul.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Blind and Lonely, But Still Singing</span></h3>
<p>She had just entered her &rsquo;teens when she was
stricken with tuberculosis. Sent to the Adirondacks,
she did not recover. Later she went to the home of
her grandparents, and there she died. She was a
member of the Sunday School in the church of
which I was then pastor. She had a sweet, clear
voice, and on special occasions she was generally
on the program for a solo.</p>
<p>When called to conduct the funeral, her relatives
told me that the night before she died she
became blind. Unable to see, she three times called,
&ldquo;Papa, Papa, Papa!&rdquo; But her father was not present
to respond to her call.</p>
<p>Not long afterwards she broke into song. Those
watching with her were deeply moved as she
began:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Be not dismayed whate&rsquo;er betide,</p>
<p class="t">God will take care of you;</p>
<p class="t0">Beneath His wings of love abide,</p>
<p class="t">God will take care of you.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
</div>
<p>She sang the entire hymn, even to the last verse:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;No matter what may be the test,</p>
<p class="t">God will take care of you;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p class="t0">Lean, weary one, upon His breast,</p>
<p class="t">God will take care of you.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">God will take care of you,</p>
<p class="t">Thro&rsquo; ev&rsquo;ry day, o&rsquo;er all the way;</p>
<p class="t0">He will take care of you,</p>
<p class="t">God will take care of you.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>When the morning came, God took her into the
heavenly home, and she had passed from darkness
and pain to light and joy.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Transfigured by Matheson&rsquo;s Hymn</span></h3>
<p>Dr. George Matheson, the blind preacher of
Edinburgh, is best remembered by his hymn, &ldquo;O
Love, that wilt not let me go,&rdquo; written when forty
years of age. &ldquo;It is the quickest composition I ever
achieved,&rdquo; wrote the author. &ldquo;It was done in three
minutes. I was sitting alone in my study in a state
of great mental depression, caused by a real calamity.
My hymn was the voice of my depression. It
was wrung out spontaneously from the heart.&rdquo; A
close friend of Matheson testified that the distinctive
ideals of this hymn &ldquo;possessed him all his
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
life.&rdquo; Many thousands of people have been stirred
and comforted by its gracious message.</p>
<p>A missionary from India attended a service in
Algiers, Africa, where about sixty people were
present, mostly tourists. After the sermon this
hymn was announced, and as the minister was reading
the first verse a man of perhaps fifty was seen
to change seats with the lady organist. Suddenly
the keys were touched and the little American
organ seemed to take on new life. Surely a master
was at the keys. He played and sang and carried
the congregation to heavenly heights of rapture.
The deep emotion of the organist, his face stained
with tears, passed to the audience and the climax
was reached when the last verse was sung:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O Cross that liftest up my head,</p>
<p class="t">I dare not ask to fly from thee;</p>
<p class="t0">I lay in dust life&rsquo;s glory dead,</p>
<p class="t0">And from the ground there blossoms red</p>
<p class="t">Life that shall endless be.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>After the service several went forward to thank
the organist. He received them with a quiet smile
and quickly left the church. It was discovered later
that he was a distinguished British singer. Two
years previous to this incident, his wife lay dying.
She was an American lady of great musical ability.
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
She asked him to sing this hymn as she was passing
into the shadow of death. And this was the first
time he had ventured to sing it again since that trying
day. No wonder his soul spoke from the
depths, as through this hymn he was passing from
the Darkness of sorrow to the Light which followed
all his way, like many another pilgrim on
the journey of trial and travail.</p>
<p class="tb">The secret of strength in weakness is given in
this confession of faith:</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Through Cheerful Years My Guide</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Consecrated and cultured, a young man began
his work in the ministry of Jesus Christ in the latter
part of the nineteenth century. Unsparing of
himself, he labored with intense earnestness. Popularity
was soon achieved, and he was placed in
responsible centers of influence. Success came to
him in each successive field of activity.</p>
<p>Faith and character had to meet severe tests.
While in the very prime of life, health failed.
Operation after operation was performed, but without
avail. Courageously he met the situation, and
though unable to do much public work, he continued
to cultivate his brilliant mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Over and over again during those last days of
weakness and suffering he quoted the hymn of Dr.
Frank Mason North, which had grown to be his
favorite among the many hymns he knew. He (the
Rev. Charles L. Peck) told the writer he believed
the hymn was destined to become increasingly popular.
It was sung at his funeral.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">&ldquo;Through Every Day&rdquo; for A Thousand Days</span></h3>
<p>He was in training to be a physician when he was
stricken with a deadly disease. He then resolved to
face the situation manfully. Dr. Merton S. Rice
thus refers to this case:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He immediately adopted every precaution in
what he knew must be a long, long contest, if he
should live. Day after day, for weeks, months and
years, that indomitable young soul fought that fight
with death. Every day he held scientific record of
his life for one thousand and fifteen days. He has
charted on an unbroken chart the full record of his
heart and his temperature, and in eleven volumes
of carefully listed observations of life pursued by
death he has left us this great story. Through it all,
and down to the very last breath of it all he has
sung, and then asked us to sing when he was gone:</p>
<div class="verse">

<p class="t0">O&rsquo;er all the way,</p>
<p class="t0">God will take care of you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb">Here is what a veteran confessed at a time when he</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Sank in Blissful Dreams Away</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I am now in my seventy-third year, and just
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
completing the fiftieth year of my ministry,&rdquo; said
the Rev. T. Ferrier Hulme, D.D., fraternal delegate
from the Wesleyan Methodist Church of England
to the General Conference of the Methodist
Episcopal Church in Kansas City, May, 1928. In
closing his address he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I give you my experience? I have known
Jesus for many years. I have been preaching for
fifty years. Twelve years ago it seemed as if my
work was done. I was laid low by a terrible illness,
and had to undergo a major operation that might
well have been fatal. My life was in the balance. I
said: &lsquo;Charles Wesley, What have you for me?
Give me something short and sweet.&rsquo; And he
gave me:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Jesus, the first and last,</p>
<p class="t0">On whom my soul is cast;</p>
<p class="t0">Thou didst Thy work begin</p>
<p class="t0">In blotting out my sin;</p>
<p class="t0">Thou wilt the root remove,</p>
<p class="t0">And perfect me in love.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Yet when the work is done,</p>
<p class="t0">The work is but begun;</p>
<p class="t0">Partaker of Thy grace</p>
<p class="t0">I long to see Thy face;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p class="t0">The first I prove below,</p>
<p class="t0">The last I die to know.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I repeated it to the last line, and then sank in
blissful dreams away. When I came out from that
nursing home, before I could walk, I just crawled
to Charles Wesley&rsquo;s grave near this home and gave
God thanks for all that Charles Wesley had been
to Christendom, and especially for what he had
been to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The following letter, quoted in part, from a
woman who underwent an operation tells of the
influence of</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Hymns in Hospital</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;I am sending you my testimony for the prayer
meeting. First I want you to thank God with me
and for me that all is well. Then ask God to bless
each and every nurse up here because they certainly
are a splendid lot. They hold chapel here every
morning. The day I was operated they sang, &lsquo;I need
thee every hour.&rsquo; I felt they were just singing that
for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was terribly frightened when I lay on the table
but I prayed that God would be near me. I certainly
felt His presence. I could not see Him, neither could
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
I see the two doctors in the operating room but I
knew they were there just the same. Do you wonder
that the first words I said after the operation
were, &lsquo;O Light that followest all my way&rsquo;?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It surely means something to have a Friend
who can go with you down even to the valley of
the shadow of death. The next morning was the
worst yet and they sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Leave, ah! leave me not alone,</p>
<p class="t0">Still support and comfort me.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of that? Why, if I had been
the only one in the hospital they could not have
sung anything better for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just across the way from me there lies a lady
very ill, and the other night while I was awake, I
heard her singing, soft and sweet and trembling,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Or if my way lie</p>
<p class="t0">Where death o&rsquo;erhanging nigh,</p>
<p class="t0">My soul doth terrify</p>
<p class="t0">With sudden chill.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And then her voice came out strong:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Yet I am not afraid:</p>
<p class="t0">Whilst softly on my head</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p class="t0">Thy tender hand is laid,</p>
<p class="t0">I fear no ill.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">Here is another testimony when</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Patients Listened to &ldquo;Precious Name&rdquo;</span></h3>
<p>Early one morning in a city hospital, above the
distracting noise, there was heard the sweet voice of
a woman repeatedly singing the refrain:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Precious Name, O how sweet!</p>
<p class="t0">Hope of earth and joy of heaven.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>No silver bell ever sounded more clearly and no
appeal was more winsome than these lines as they
were heard by the sick and dying. It is not known
whether she herself was a sufferer. In any case her
message wafted through the air came with cheering
timeliness to the men and women on their beds of
sickness. One who heard it then has not forgotten
its effect after fifteen years, and it will be a choice
memory for years to come.</p>
<p class="tb">The reference to the bell recalls an incident when</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Church Bells Reminded Her Of an Old Hymn</span></h3>
<p>An aged saint who dwelt beneath the shadow of
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
her church was lying in a last sickness and it occurred
to her pastor that the peals, breaking the stillness
of the night, might disturb her. On being told
about it, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, I love to hear them. It&rsquo;s the kirk
bell; and whenever I hear it, it makes me think of
the hymns we used to sing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Far, far away, like bells at evening pealing,</p>
<p class="t0">The voice of Jesus sounds o&rsquo;er land and sea.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>She then added, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s His voice, and it&rsquo;s sic a comfort
to me. I aye weary to hear it.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Hymns Mothers Loved</i></span></h2>
<p>It may be disputed whether religion is an inheritance
or an acquisition but the fact remains that the
influence of personality is the final explanation.
And who has exercised such a power more beneficially
than mothers? They constitute the heart of
every home, the first and the last in everything.
Whoever may fail us in the tumult and struggle of
life, our mothers have never gone back on us but
have remained steadfast even at the cost of incredible
sacrifices. Indeed, mothers hold the key to every
difficult situation in life, and they have opened
doors closed to every other approach. During the
World War most of the letters from the Front
were written by the boys to their mothers, and this
daily mail ran far into the tons.</p>
<p>By their faith, devotion and consolation our
mothers have done for us what no other mortals
have ever been capable of doing. Even when we are
inclined to make an exception of our wives, it is
really the mother instinct in them which makes
them so indispensable to us. Quick in sympathy,
ready in resource, patient in trials, versatile in
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
ability and adaptability, mothers stand sentinel in
the crises of life, and because of intuition and inspiration
they are the saviors of society.</p>
<p>God be praised for our mothers, and may the
blessing of the Eternal Father abide with all
mothers, that they may continue to fulfill their gracious
ministry for the highest welfare of mankind.
This sheaf of testimonies bears glowing witness
from grateful hearts to the sacramental virtue of
mothers. May their memory be forever blessed!</p>
<p class="tb">The Bible and the hymnal were the two books
from which our mothers received their spiritual replenishment.
This poem by the Rev. G. H. Winkworth
tells of the hymnal which he fittingly describes
as</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Old Brown Book</span></h3>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And who can tell but what in heaven above</p>
<p class="t0">They sing again the old sweet hymns we love?</p>

<h3><span class="sc">The Note of Assurance in the Old Hymns</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;I came the other day upon a Methodist hymnal
bearing the date of 1877, and in it I found the
hymns which my mother loved to quote, and I was
struck with their depth of emotion, their genuine
spiritual quality. They have a note of profound assurance
which I miss in the modern hymns.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Leader of faithful souls, and guide</p>
<p class="t">Of all who travel to the sky,</p>
<p class="t0">Come and with us, even us, abide</p>
<p class="t">Who would on Thee alone rely.</p>
<p class="t0">On Thee alone our spirits stay</p>
<p class="t">While held in life&rsquo;s uneven way.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;How fine is the crusading note in this verse!
Particularly noble in sentiment and emotion are the
numerous hymns dealing with death and the future
state. Here is one which I confess I read with tears:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Rejoice for a brother deceased,</p>
<p class="t">Our loss is his infinite gain;</p>
<p class="t0">A soul out of prison released,</p>
<p class="t">And freed from its bodily chain.</p>
<p class="t0">With songs let us follow his flight</p>
<p class="t">And mount with his spirit above,</p>
<p class="t0">Escaped to the mansions of light,</p>
<p class="t">And lodged in the Eden of love.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>One can fancy this hymn sung by Cornish fishermen
over one of their numbers lost at sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The sacred memories of the past may slumber
for a while but they are often awakened under
favorable conditions, as seen on this occasion, as
reported in <i>The British Weekly</i>, when</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Canadian Railroad Men Sang In Memory of Mother</span></h3>
<p>A student of Manitoba University, Winnipeg,
accepted camp service for the long vacation in connection
with the building of the last transcontinental
railroad in Canada. He became one of the
men and soon made friends with them. After the
midday meal on the first Sunday he asked &ldquo;the
boys&rdquo; if they would &ldquo;roll up&rdquo; to the service he
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
proposed to hold? The tent was crowded. He
started the service by asking if any of them remembered
their mother&rsquo;s favorite hymn. He was answered
at once by one who said his mother liked
best &ldquo;Rock of Ages, Cleft For Me.&rdquo; So it was sung,
and, like other &ldquo;mothers&rsquo; favorites,&rdquo; it was sung
over and over again. The service continued till
eleven o&rsquo;clock and under that star-lit northern sky
they left the tent for their bunks, resolving that
the God of the old home should be their God. By
many a bunk that night the prayer went to heaven:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Rock of Ages, cleft for me,</p>
<p class="t0">Let me hide myself in Thee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">The result was equally beneficial in another instance
when John Callahan</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Heard Mother&rsquo;s Hymn in a Mission</span></h3>
<p>He was long superintendent of Hadley Mission
in New York City, and known as &ldquo;the Bishop of
the Bowery.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;It was &lsquo;Abide With Me&rsquo;
that I heard in a mission, and that I had not heard
since it was sung when I was six years old at my
mother&rsquo;s funeral, that brought me to my senses and
made me realize that I was not traveling on the
right road.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p class="tb">The same effect was produced at the front when
fond memories made</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Voices Husky With Emotion</span></h3>
<p>The message of the Gospel took on a reality it
had never worn before as the story of the Cross
was recounted by the Salvationists to the American
soldiers in France. The thunder of artillery was
heard; and the flashing of signal lights, together
with the hum of the airplanes, vivified the whole
background of war. After an address on the God
of their mothers a young woman began to sing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I grieved my Lord from day to day,</p>
<p class="t">I scorned His love so full and free,</p>
<p class="t0">And though I wandered far away,</p>
<p class="t">My mother&rsquo;s prayers have followed me.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;m coming home, I&rsquo;m coming home,</p>
<p class="t">To live my wasted life anew,</p>
<p class="t0">For mother&rsquo;s prayers have followed me,</p>
<p class="t">Have followed me the whole world through.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Many hearts echoed the words; and the voices
of the men were husky with emotion when they
tried to join in the closing hymn.</p>
<p class="tb">A different testimony is given where one</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Wanted to Hear the Hymns That Mother Loved Best</span></h3>
<p>Countess Somers, the mother of Lady Henry

Evanston, Illinois. The little guide-book, <i>Historic

<p>&ldquo;When this music-box was to be made, Miss

<p class="tb">Concerning this first hymn the following incident

<h3><span class="sc">Saluted Her Favorite Hymn</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;There was the gay summer &lsquo;garden party&rsquo; at
Rest Cottage (Evanston, Illinois) in honor of
Anna Gordon&rsquo;s birthday with Miss Willard as
master of ceremonies, when speeches and presentation
of gifts, poems and tributes, were in order.
And at the close all united in singing &lsquo;How firm a
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
foundation,&rsquo; as the aged saint, Miss Willard&rsquo;s venerable
mother, then in her closing eighty-eighth
year, rose on the upper balcony, where she sat
enjoying the bright scene in the garden, to wave
her handkerchief in salutation at the words of her
favorite hymn,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;And when hoary hairs shall their temples adorn,</p>
<p class="t0">Like lambs they shall still in My bosom be borne.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">The substantial faith of mothers is illustrated in
the case of one who</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Sang the Nicene Creed</span></h3>
<p>The sixth child in a family of eight, Joseph Von
Wittig was born in a one-room cottage. He tells us
how his mother used to sing before her marriage
in the choir of the village church. &ldquo;What did you
like best to sing, mother?&rdquo; he once asked her, and
she answered, &ldquo;The Creed.&rdquo; He remembered a day
when she was busy with field-work, and he heard
her clear voice rising in the closing words of the
Nicene Creed, <i>et vitam venturi s&aelig;culi</i>, &ldquo;and the
life of the world to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The foretaste of the life to come has been enjoyed
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
in the present life, to judge from these words
by Bishop Adna W. Leonard, in his book, <i>Evangelism
in the Remaking of the World</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> concerning
his mother&rsquo;s</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Singing While Sleeping</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;My own dear mother as she lay upon her dying
bed, after many years of the severest suffering and
invalidhood, fell into a very sound sleep. It was
only a night or two before her outgoing. My father
was keeping his faithful vigil, when suddenly he
heard a familiar voice singing,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;O Thou, in whose presence my soul takes delight,</p>
<p class="t">On whom in affliction I call,</p>
<p class="t0">My comfort by day, and my song in the night,</p>
<p class="t">My hope, my salvation, my all!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was my mother&rsquo;s voice singing in a marvelously
clear tone the hymn that had been a favorite
with her all her life. Though asleep she sang every
verse clear through to the end. Other members of
the family were awakened by it and listened in
breathless silence, for it was like the song of an
angel. She did not waken for some time after she
had ceased singing, and when told of what had
taken place she was not surprised, for the hymns of
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
the church had been such a comfort to her throughout
her entire life.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Another witness is Dr. Oscar L. Joseph who on
every Mother&rsquo;s Day has his congregation sing</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Peace, Perfect Peace</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Beyond all other hymns, his mother loved this
one written by Bishop Edward H. Bickersteth. She
often sang it in the family circle. No burden or distraction
could interfere with the &ldquo;perfect peace&rdquo;
which Christ imparted to her soul. Hence, when
she died, it was the message she wished to have set
over her resting place. So on her tombstone in Ceylon
may be found the three words:</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;Peace, Perfect Peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the members of the congregation hear
this bit of family history from the lips of their pastor,
they most feelingly sing at his request:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Peace, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin?</p>
<p class="t0">The blood of Jesus whispers peace within.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Peace, perfect peace, by thronging duties pressed?</p>
<p class="t0">To do the will of Jesus,&mdash;this is rest.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">. . . <span class="hst">. . .</span> <span class="hst">. . .</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Peace, perfect peace, our future all unknown?</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus, we know, and He is on the throne.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">. . . <span class="hst">. . .</span> <span class="hst">. . .</span></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It is enough: earth&rsquo;s struggles soon shall cease,</p>
<p class="t0">And Jesus call us to heaven&rsquo;s perfect peace.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">The sacrificial loyalty to Christ is seen when</p>
<h3><span class="sc">A Mother Answered with a Hymn</span></h3>
<p>A missionary secretary of one of the Methodist
churches in England once went to see a mother
whose only remaining son had offered himself for
foreign mission service. Two other sons had gone
to the same country and there they had laid down
their lives in the service of Christ and the natives.
The secretary sympathetically referred to this pathetic
fact, and wished to ascertain from the mother
whether the last of her boys was to go with her full
consent.</p>
<p>The mother grasped the trend of the visitor&rsquo;s
conversation, and, without waiting for the secretary
to put the direct question, she very quietly repeated
the lines she so often sang in church, which conveyed
her spirit of surrender:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Were the whole realm of nature mine,</p>
<p class="t">That were a present far too small;</p>
<p class="t0">Love so amazing, so divine,</p>
<p class="t">Demands my soul, my life, my all.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>There was no need for further questioning. The
secretary said in my hearing, &ldquo;I knelt with that
mother and her boy and we had a tearful but beautiful
season of prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">It is not surprising that in the soldiers&rsquo; hours of
danger, according to <i>The War Romance of the Salvation
Army</i>, by Booth and Hill,<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a></p>
<h3><span class="sc">Mother Held Her Place in Their Hearts</span></h3>
<p>The night of the St. Mihiel drive was the blackest
night ever seen. It was so dark that one could
positively see nothing a foot ahead of him. All that
was heard was the sound of thousands of feet
tramping, through the mud and slush, as the soldiers
went to the front. In groups they were singing
softly as they went by. One group was singing
&ldquo;Mother Machree.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a spot in me heart that no colleen may own,</p>
<p class="t0">There&rsquo;s a depth in me soul never sounded or known;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p class="t0">There&rsquo;s a place in me memory, me life, that you fill,</p>
<p class="t0">No other can take it, no one ever will;</p>
<p class="t0">Sure, I love the dear silver that shines in your hair,</p>
<p class="t0">And the brow that&rsquo;s all furrowed and wrinkled with care.</p>
<p class="t0">I kiss the dear fingers, so toil-worn for me;</p>
<p class="t3">O, God bless you and keep you!</p>
<p class="t6">Mother Machree!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The simple pathos of the men&rsquo;s voices, many of
whom were tramping forward to their death,
brought tears to the eyes of the Salvation Army
lassies in the canteen.</p>
<p>After an interval, sweetly and solemnly through
the chill of the darkness there came floating by,
with a thrill in the words, another group of voices:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Abide with me! Fast falls the eventide,</p>
<p class="t0">The darkness deepens&mdash;Lord, with me abide!&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>When Preachers Sing</i></span></h2>
<p>Even in these days of pulpit exchanges, ministers
show their denominational alliances in their sermons.
Not so when it comes to hymns, which are
more catholic and comprehensive than creeds and
other ecclesiastical pronouncements. Indeed, the
hymnal of any church contains the writings of
Catholics and of Protestants of every variety, for
most hymns express the deeper aspirations of the
soul without any sectarian accent. They are admitted
into these compilations because of their intrinsic
worth as transcripts from Christian experience,
dealing with the essential truths of the Gospel.
There is a healthy omission of those incidentals
which interrupt whole-hearted Christian fellowship
with all who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ
and accept Him as their central authority.</p>
<p>If our preaching were as free and fervent as the
hymns sung by ministers and people, and if our
practice more closely harmonized with the sentiments
in hymns, the day of Christian union would
come more quickly. Here are some incidents which
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
illustrate the ability of ministers to make melody
in their hearts as unto the Lord.</p>
<p class="tb">It is in a crisis that the depths of the heart are
exposed as here when</p>
<h3><span class="sc">A Minister Requested His Favorite Hymn</span></h3>
<p>Dr. R. W. Dale, of Birmingham, England,
preached a beautiful sermon in memory of his college
friend, the Rev. E. S. Glanville, of Warwick.
He told how the dying minister had requested his
father and sister to sing to him his favorite hymn,
and they sat in the chamber of death and sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;There is a land of pure delight,</p>
<p class="t">Where saints immortal reign;</p>
<p class="t0">Infinite day excludes the night,</p>
<p class="t">And pleasures banish pain.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">Equally significant was the</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Marching Song of Veteran Ministers</span></h3>
<p>When the names of the forty-five retired ministers
were called in the Baltimore Annual Conference
of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in
1930, these men who were facing the sunset period
of life stood and sang:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Come, we that love the Lord,</p>
<p class="t">And let our joys be known;</p>
<p class="t0">Join in a song with sweet accord</p>
<p class="t">And thus surround the throne.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The light that never was on sea or land&rdquo; crept
into their faces as they recalled the days and the
songs of their pilgrimage, and blended their voices
in the triumphant refrain:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re marching to Zion,</p>
<p class="t">Beautiful, beautiful Zion;</p>
<p class="t0">We&rsquo;re marching upward to Zion,</p>
<p class="t">The beautiful city of God.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then, to give emphatic expression to their Christian
joy, when Dr. Charles W. Baldwin, a veteran
leader, ninety-one years of age, gave the signal,
they exclaimed in unison: &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">But those who are in active service show their
spirit of consecration by being</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Ready for Another Day&rsquo;s Work</span></h3>
<p>The business had been transacted, the committees
had reported, and the resolutions of appreciation
had been read. The closing moments of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
Methodist Conference were approaching. Soon the
presiding bishop would read the appointments, and
one hundred and eighty ministers would enter on a
new year of ministry. Several of these would be
assigned to new fields.</p>
<p>Many had seen years of service. For some of
them this would probably be the closing year, for it
generally happens that during the year some fall
at the post of duty. But among the number there
were nine young men who for the first time would
enter on their great adventure of ministerial
service.</p>
<p>The closing hymn selected was one rarely heard
at such a moment, yet it was impressively appealing,
and soon all the ministers were blending their
voices in the words of Miss Warner:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;One more day&rsquo;s work for Jesus,</p>
<p class="t0">One less of life for me!</p>
<p class="t">But heaven is nearer,</p>
<p class="t">And Christ is dearer</p>
<p class="t0">Than yesterday, to me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">In connection with what was said above about
young ministers, it was an impressive occasion</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<h3><span class="sc">When a Bishop Sang at the Ordination Service</span></h3>
<p>A group of young men were ordained into the
ministry of the Methodist Episcopal Church on a
glorious Sunday afternoon in May in the presence
of many hundreds of ministers, relatives and
others. The service apparently was about to end
when Bishop Adna W. Leonard knelt inside the
altar by the side of these young preachers. By pre-arrangement
with the organist, the strains of music
softly came and then the voice of the bishop was
heard singing the expressively appropriate words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;It may not be on the mountain&rsquo;s height,</p>
<p class="t">Or over the stormy sea;</p>
<p class="t0">It may not be at the battle&rsquo;s front</p>
<p class="t">My Lord will have need of me;</p>
<p class="t0">But if by a still small voice He calls</p>
<p class="t">To paths that I do not know,</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in Thine,</p>
<p class="t">I&rsquo;ll go where You want me to go.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The young ministers who had just taken upon
themselves the solemn vows of the ordination service
then joined with the soloist in the chorus:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go where You want me to go, dear Lord,</p>
<p class="t">O&rsquo;er mountain or plain or sea;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ll say what You want me to say, dear Lord,</p>
<p class="t">I&rsquo;ll be what You want me to be.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The voice of the bishop was again heard:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Perhaps today there are loving words</p>
<p class="t">Which Jesus would have me speak;</p>
<p class="t0">There may be now in the paths of sin</p>
<p class="t">Some wanderer whom I should seek.</p>
<p class="t0">O Saviour, if Thou wilt be my guide,</p>
<p class="t">Tho&rsquo; dark and rugged the way,</p>
<p class="t0">My voice shall echo Thy message sweet,</p>
<p class="t">I&rsquo;ll say what You want me to say.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then for the second time, the young ministers
united their voices with the one who was leading
them in song, as together they rendered the chorus.</p>
<p>The third stanza followed, by the Bishop:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s surely somewhere a lowly place,</p>
<p class="t">In earth&rsquo;s harvest fields so wide,</p>
<p class="t0">Where I may labor through earth&rsquo;s short day,</p>
<p class="t">For Jesus the crucified;</p>
<p class="t0">So trusting my all to His tender care,</p>
<p class="t">And knowing Thou lovest me,</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ll do Thy will with a heart sincere,</p>
<p class="t">I&rsquo;ll be what You want me to be.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Hundreds of eyes by this time were mist-filled,
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
and it was with difficulty that many could control
their voices when Bishop Leonard asked the entire
company to sing the refrain. Soon, however, about
twelve hundred voices were songfully pledging
their loyalty to their Lord as they sang the words
of the chorus.</p>
<p>Few were the words spoken by the leader of the
service before another hymn was rendered:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I need Thee every hour,</p>
<p class="t">Most gracious Lord;</p>
<p class="t0">No tender voice like Thine</p>
<p class="t">Can peace afford.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>These lines voiced a prayer for divine strength,
guidance and blessing. With the young ministers
now standing at the altar, young people were asked
to consecrate their lives to the service of Christ.
From all parts of that historic church young men
and young women moved forward until sixty of
them had publicly registered their decision. Some
of them for the first time took their stand for
Christ, others expressed a desire to become ministers,
missionaries, workers in their home churches.</p>
<p>The effects of this service will remain for many
years. For there went forth from that church in
the central part of the Empire State of New York
a great company of hearts touched by the Spirit of
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
God and resolved to render faithful devotion to
Christ&rsquo;s cause.</p>
<p class="tb">The consciousness of the divine providence was
emphasized in the confession:</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Thou My Daily Task Shall Give</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>When sixty ministers, heads of various Summer
Schools of Ministerial Training in the Methodist
Episcopal Church, met in Evanston, Illinois, to
review the work of the previous year and to plan
for the future, the leader of the devotions one
morning called attention to a hymn of great personal
value. Then, on that January day, it was sung
with deep feeling as the ministers were just entering
on their task for another year. This hymn was
written by a layman, Josiah Conder, who &ldquo;passed a
busy life as bookseller, editor and author.&rdquo; It is
well worth committing to memory; at least, such
was the conviction of that group of ministers who
sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Day by day the manna fell:</p>
<p class="t0">O to learn this lesson well!</p>
<p class="t0">Still by constant mercy fed,</p>
<p class="t0">Give me, Lord, my daily bread.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Day by day,&rsquo; the promise reads,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p class="t0">Daily strength for daily needs:</p>
<p class="t0">Cast foreboding fears away;</p>
<p class="t0">Take the manna of today.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord! my times are in Thy hand:</p>
<p class="t0">All my sanguine hopes have planned,</p>
<p class="t0">To Thy wisdom I resign,</p>
<p class="t0">And would make Thy purpose mine.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thou my daily task shalt give:</p>
<p class="t0">Day by day to Thee I live;</p>
<p class="t0">So shall added years fulfill,</p>
<p class="t0">Not my own, my Father&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">The assurance of divine guidance was expressed
in the declaration:</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">All My Help From Thee I Bring</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;When ... storms of unpopularity and tempests
of financial disaster threaten the tiny bark
upon life&rsquo;s troubled seas,&rdquo; wrote Sir Henry Lunn,
&ldquo;my friend and colleague, Hugh Price Hughes,
whose ministry in some small degree I shared,
asked me to believe with confidence that there was
One &lsquo;in the heavens to give attention to our personal
concerns,&rsquo; and taught me to say with a new
emphasis, &lsquo;Thou, O Christ, art all I want,&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Other refuge have I none,</p>
<p class="t">Hangs my helpless soul on Thee,</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">. . . <span class="hst">. . .</span> <span class="hst">. . .</span></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">All my trust on Thee is stayed,</p>
<p class="t">All my help from Thee I bring.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now that the limit of three score years and
ten is passed and life&rsquo;s journey must be drawing to
a close, I say triumphantly: &lsquo;Here I raise my Ebenezer.
Hitherto the Lord hath helped me and hither
by His grace I have come.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Episcopal dignity was enriched on a recent occasion
when, according to <i>Zion&rsquo;s Herald</i>,</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Bishops Sang Their Special Hymn</span></h3>
<p>When the bishops of the Methodist Episcopal
Church held their semi-annual meeting in San
Francisco, in November, 1929, they were given a
reception and a banquet. Eight hundred persons
assembled to do them honor, including officials of
the city and the state. The bishops contributed
a vocal number to the evening&rsquo;s entertainment.
Bishop Francis J. McConnell, with his richly melodious
voice, led his colleagues in the episcopal
hymn, &lsquo;Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
it doth not yet appear what we shall be.&rsquo; Those
present insisted on an encore, but as the episcopal
repertoire is limited to a single number, the bishops
could only modestly bow their acknowledgments
to the sustained applause.</p>
<p class="tb">But these bishops are not really confined to just
one hymn, for they also sang on another occasion</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Land Me Safe on Canaan&rsquo;s Side</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>The most remarkable feature of the singing of
the Board of Bishops of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, wrote Bishop Francis J. McConnell, when
reporting one of their meetings in Boston in May,
1930, consisted in their skill in fitting almost any
song to the &ldquo;only tune which I have heard them
sing with any conspicuous success.&rdquo; Reference was
then made to a dramatic moment &ldquo;when that one
tune was sung with marvelous power.&rdquo; Bishop Earl
Cranston, at the age of eighty-nine, &ldquo;had just
made a farewell speech in which he had said that
he did not see how he could again attend the
Bishops&rsquo; Meeting. At the conclusion of the address
the bishops sang, adapting their favorite tune, the
stanza: &lsquo;When I tread the verge of Jordan.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>One can easily imagine that scene, and how
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
deeply affected the others were after listening to
the words of the veteran leader. It is difficult to
conceive anything which would have been more
appropriate for such a time than the words in which
the company blended their voices:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;When I tread the verge of Jordan,</p>
<p class="t">Bid my anxious fears subside;</p>
<p class="t0">Bear me through the swelling current,</p>
<p class="t">Land me safe on Canaan&rsquo;s side:</p>
<p class="t4">Songs of praises</p>
<p class="t2">I will ever give to Thee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">This confidence of immortality is also shared by
others as seen on a memorable occasion when</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Ministers Sang Their Hope</span></h3>
<p>Many ministers had assembled to pay their last
tribute to a comrade who had fallen while in the
ranks of service. Words of commendation were
spoken concerning the fidelity and devotion of the
one whom God had called in the prime of life.
Prayers were offered. Soon the body, accompanied
by the bereaved relatives, would start for the little
cemetery in the boyhood home. But before leaving
the church where the services were conducted, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
ministers stepped forward, surrounded the casket,
and united their voices in singing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a land that is fairer than day,</p>
<p class="t">And by faith we can see it afar;</p>
<p class="t0">For the Father waits over the way,</p>
<p class="t">To prepare us a dwelling-place there.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The refrain voiced the assurance of immortality
cherished and preached by that company of pastors:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;In the sweet by-and-by,</p>
<p class="t0">We shall meet on that beautiful shore.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Songs of Soldiers</i></span></h2>
<p>When faced by the stern realities of life and
death, it is not easy for any person to practice the
subtle art of camouflage so far as faith and destiny
are concerned. The experiences of G. A. Studdert-Kennedy,
one of the war chaplains at the Front,
were similar to those of other men engaged in ministering
to the religious needs of the soldiers. He
was once brought face to face with one of the boys
in a crisis, and was asked the pointed question:
&ldquo;What is God like?&rdquo; The soldiers who know that
God is like Christ the Sufferer and Sympathizer,
have an assurance that gives them courage to go
through the rough and distracting ordeal on the
field of battle. This was true in the World War
and in all similar grim encounters.</p>
<p>Another chaplain, Thomas Tiplady, wrote that
when the great hours draw near, and even in the
lighter hours, the soldiers like hymns most of all,
and at the religious services they cannot have too
many hymns. They care little for patriotic songs
since they are living their patriotism in the severe
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
struggle with the enemy. The hymns for which
they have a special preference are those which give
them cheer and hope and deepen their consciousness
of the presence of the Comrade Christ.</p>
<p>These incidents belong to our Civil War and to
later wars. But in essence they bear on the same
themes and frankly reveal the recesses and the resources
of the soul.</p>
<p class="tb">The unexpected turns in war are illustrated in</p>
<h3><span class="sc">A Memory of Pickett&rsquo;s Brigade</span></h3>
<p>Reminiscences were being exchanged by veterans
of both sides of the Civil War at a banquet given
in their honor by the Board of Trade of New York
City. Colonel J. J. Phillips, of the Ninth Virginia
Regiment, Pickett&rsquo;s Division, presided. Speaking of
night attacks, he recalled one in particular because
of the peculiar circumstances which resulted almost
in the compulsory disobedience of orders, in response
to a higher command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The point of attack had been carefully selected,&rdquo;
said Colonel Phillips, &ldquo;the awaited dark
night had arrived, and my command was to fire
when General Pickett should signal the order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was that dread, indescribable stillness;
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
that weird ominous silence that always settles over
everything before a fight. You felt that nowhere in
the universe was there any voice or motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly the awesome silence was broken by
the sound of a deep, full voice rolling over the
black void like the billows of a great sea, directly in
line with our guns. It was singing the old hymn,
&lsquo;Jesus, Lover of My Soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard that grand old music many times
in circumstances which intensified its impressiveness,
but never had it seemed so solemn as when it
broke the stillness in which we waited for the order
to fire. Just as it was given there rang through the
night the words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Cover my defenseless head</p>
<p class="t">With the shadow of Thy wing.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ready, aim! Fire to the left, boys!&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guns were shifted, the volley that blazed
out swerved aside, and that &lsquo;defenseless head&rsquo; was
&lsquo;covered&rsquo; with the shadow of His wing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Federal veteran who listened to this story
spoke up and said, &ldquo;I remember that night, Colonel,
and that midnight attack which carried off so many
of my comrades. I was the singer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such confirmation produced a deep impression,
and after a silence &ldquo;Jesus, Lover of My Soul&rdquo; was
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
again sung as on the fatal night in 1864 when it
rang across the lines at Bermuda Hundred.</p>
<p class="tb">The reference to the same leader is brought out
under exceptional circumstances in</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Song of the Defeated</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;Written in Defeat, After the Battle of Five
Forks,&rdquo; is the heading given to a letter written by
General George E. Pickett to his wife, April 2,
1865. It is included by Arthur Crew Inman in his
volume, <i>A Soldier of the South</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> Here is part of it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All is quiet now, but soon all will be bustle,
for we march at daylight. Oh, my darling, were
there ever such men as those of my division? This
morning after the review I thanked them for their
valiant services yesterday on the first of April,
never to be forgotten by any of us, when they
fought one of the most desperate battles of the
whole war. Their answer to me was cheer after
cheer, one after another calling out, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all
right, Marse George!&rsquo; and &lsquo;We only followed
you!&rsquo; Then in the midst of these calls, silencing
them, rose loud and clear old Gentry&rsquo;s voice, singing
the old hymns which they all knew I loved:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Guide me, oh, Thou great Jehovah,</p>
<p class="t0">Pilgrim through this barren land.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Voice after voice joined in till from all along
the line the plea rang forth:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Be my sword and shield and banner,</p>
<p class="t0">Be the Lord my righteousness.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think, my Sallie, the tears sounded in
my voice as it mingled with theirs; but they were
in my eyes, and there was something new in my
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the last line had been sung, I gave the
order to march ...&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">What the soldiers felt in the depths of their
life is revealed in</p>
<h3><span class="sc">A Chorus of Ten Thousand</span></h3>
<p>The night after the Battle of Shiloh, when there
were thousands of wounded on the field, one Christian
soldier as he lay there dying under the starlight
began to sing, &ldquo;There is a land of pure
delight.&rdquo; When he reached the next line there
were scores of voices singing, &ldquo;Where saints immortal
reign.&rdquo; The song was caught up all through
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
the fields among the wounded until it was said
there were at least ten thousand wounded men
uniting in the triumphant closing verse of that
beautiful hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Could we but climb where Moses stood,</p>
<p class="t">And view the landscape o&rsquo;er,</p>
<p class="t0">Not Jordan&rsquo;s stream, nor death&rsquo;s cold flood,</p>
<p class="t">Should fright us from the shore.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">Mrs. Margaret Bottome relates an incident about</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Marching to Music</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;I had a brother who was in the Battle of the
Wilderness during the Civil War. He told me of a
day in that dreadful wilderness when the Connecticut
regiment was traveling through such deep mud
that they could hardly pull their boots out of it
as they took one step after another. They were
thoroughly dispirited and they had no music&mdash;the
band was far in the rear, but all at once they heard
the sound that told them the band was coming, and
as it drew nearer they caught the strain. The band
was playing a tune known to every Methodist:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Come on, my partners in distress,</p>
<p class="t0">My comrades through the wilderness,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p class="t">Who still their bodies feel.</p>
<p class="t0">Awhile forget your griefs and fears</p>
<p class="t0">And look beyond this vale of tears</p>
<p class="t">To that celestial hill.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;My brother said it acted like magic on that
regiment, the largest proportion of which were
Methodists; new life entered into them. A moment
before their feet had stuck in the mud, and they did
not see how they were ever to get along, for again
and again they had to pull their boots out of the
mud with their hands, but from the time that tune,
with the words that memory made so distinct, was
heard, not a step faltered.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a></p>
<p class="tb">This story from the Crimean War might be
duplicated from other wars for it tells of</p>
<h3><span class="sc">A Soldier Saved by Song</span></h3>
<p>Duncan Matheson, a Bible reader to the soldiers
in the Crimea, was returning one night to his lodgings
in an old stable. Sickened by the sights he had
seen, and depressed with the thought that the siege
of Sebastopol was likely to last for months, he
trudged along in the mud, knee-deep. Happening
to look up, he saw the stars shining calmly in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
clear sky. Weariness gave place to the thought that
in heaven is rest, and he began to sing aloud the
old hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;How bright these glorious spirits shine!</p>
<p class="t">Whence all their bright array?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The next day was wet and stormy. While going
his rounds he met a soldier, soiled and in ragged
clothes; his shoes so worn that they did not keep
his feet from the mud. In the course of conversation
this man said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not what I was yesterday. Last night I
was tired of life and of this blundering siege. I
took my musket and went down yonder, determined
to blow out my brains. As I got around that
hillock I heard some one singing, &lsquo;How bright
these glorious spirits shine!&rsquo; It recalled to me the
Sunday School where I used to sing it, and the
religious truths I had heard there. I felt ashamed
of being such a coward. I said to myself, &lsquo;Here is a
comrade as badly off as I am, but he is not a coward&mdash;he&rsquo;s
bearing it!&rsquo; I felt that man had something
which I did not possess to make him accept
with cheerfulness our hard lot. I went back to my
tent, and today I am seeking that thing which made
the singer so happy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p class="tb">Here is another from the World War, related in
<i>The War Romance of the Salvation Army</i>, by
Booth and Hill,<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> how</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Sunshine Came Into a Soldier&rsquo;s Heart</span></h3>
<p>It was one Sunday afternoon in Bazeilles,
France, at a service conducted by three Salvationists.
One of the girls sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s sunshine in my soul today,</p>
<p class="t">More glorious and bright</p>
<p class="t0">Than glows in any earthly skies,</p>

<p class="t0">O there&rsquo;s sunshine, blessed sunshine,</p>
<p class="t">When the peaceful, happy moments roll;</p>
<p class="t0">When Jesus shows His smiling face,</p>
<p class="t">There is sunshine in the soul.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a></p>
</div>
<p>The sequel is best explained in a letter written
to his mother by one of the boys:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be surprised to hear that I am in the
hospital, but I am getting well quickly and am having
a good time. But best of all, some Salvation
Army people came along and sang and talked about
sunshine, and while they were talking the sunshine
came through my window&mdash;not into my
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
room alone, but into my heart and life as well,
where it is going to stay. I know how happy this
will make you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">An incident from the Spanish-American War reveals
the unity of Christian faith in the way</p>
<h3><span class="sc">American Soldiers Greeted Christmas</span></h3>
<p>Christmas Eve, 1898, found the Seventh Army
Corps encamped along the hills at Quemados, near
Havana, Cuba. Suddenly from the camp of the
Forty-ninth Iowa rang a sentinel&rsquo;s call, &ldquo;Number
ten; twelve o&rsquo;clock, and all&rsquo;s well!&rdquo; Lieutenant-Colonel
Curtis Guild thus wrote about it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Christmas morning. Scarcely had the cry
of the sentinel died away, when from the bandsmen&rsquo;s
tents of that same regiment there rose the
music of an old, familiar hymn, and one clear baritone
voice led the chorus that quickly ran along the
moonlit fields: &lsquo;How firm a foundation ye saints
of the Lord!&rsquo; Another voice joined in, and another,
and another, and in a moment the whole
regiment was singing, and then the Sixth Missouri
joined in with the Fourth Virginia, and all the rest,
till there on the long ridges above the city ... a
whole American army corps was singing:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Fear not, I am with thee, O be not dismayed,</p>
<p class="t0">For I am thy God, and will still give thee aid;</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,</p>
<p class="t0">Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Protestant and Catholic, South and North, singing
together on Christmas day in the morning,&mdash;that&rsquo;s
an American army!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">We next go to Palestine for two stories. One
is about</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Soldiers and Sankey&rsquo;s Hymns</span></h3>
<p>At a meeting in Blackheath, London, some time
ago, according to a writer in <i>The British Weekly</i>, a
missionary to the Jews related one of his experiences
at a Jewish settlement in Palestine. He asked
to see the head of the settlement, who said, &ldquo;Are
you an Englishman?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; feeling
that perhaps he would not be pleased. Then he
said, &ldquo;Are you a missionary?&rdquo; And he answered
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; feeling certain now he would not be pleased.
To his astonishment the man said, &ldquo;Oh, I am so
glad, so very glad. And can you play the piano?&rdquo;
to which he answered &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The missionary was then told that when the soldiers
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
were there they came almost daily and played
Sankey&rsquo;s hymns on the piano, and sang them. The
people in the house crowded round to listen, and
others gathered outside. The result was that there
were about thirty people in the settlement who
wanted to become Christians, and the missionary
stayed there for a month, at the end of which time
they were baptized.</p>
<p class="tb">The other is from Mrs. Carrie J. Bond about</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Marching Men</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;A few years ago I was in Jerusalem in the
American Colony Home. It was a bright moonlight
night and I heard the marching feet of soldiers.
Soon they began singing &lsquo;The End of a Perfect
Day.&rsquo; I looked out to see about twelve soldiers
marching by. In the morning I asked my host
about it and he brought out an old worn sheet of
&lsquo;A Perfect Day&rsquo; and told me this story: Two
American boys had been billeted to the American
Colony House and every evening during their stay
one had played and the other had sung that song.
When they were well enough to leave they left the
music as a token of their gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p class="tb">Now we go to the Transvaal for a testimony to
the influence of Fanny Crosby&rsquo;s hymn, &ldquo;Blessed
Assurance,&rdquo; as related by Mr. Sankey,<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> which
might be entitled</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Six Further On</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;During the recent war in the Transvaal,&rsquo; said
a gentleman in my meeting in Exeter Hall, London,
in 1900, &lsquo;when the soldiers going to the front
were passing another body of soldiers whom they
recognized, their greetings used to be, &ldquo;Four-nine-four,
boys, four-nine-four;&rdquo; and the salute would
invariably be answered with &ldquo;Six further on, boys;
six further on.&rdquo; The significance of this was that,
in &ldquo;Sacred Songs and Solos,&rdquo; a number of copies of
the small edition of which had been sent to the
front, Number 494 was &ldquo;God Be With You Till
We Meet Again&rdquo;; and six further on than 494, or
Number 500, was &ldquo;Blessed Assurance, Jesus Is
Mine.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The last incident brings us back to the World
War in the touching words,</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Sing It Again, Laddie</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>In times of stress, Scotsmen turn toward God,
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
for in the heart of them they are all religiously
inclined. During the World War a service in the
historic church in Ayr, Scotland, began with that
beautiful Psalm paraphrase: &ldquo;I to the hills will lift
mine eyes&rdquo;, sung to the tune of &ldquo;French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sermon had a reference to a young Highlander
who was wounded in a recent battle and lay
stretched on the field. In his youth he had learned
&ldquo;I to the hills&rdquo; in Gaelic. He now began to sing
that old Psalm in his native tongue, and out over
the field his singing reached as far as his voice
would carry. Just then a Scotch regiment came
marching by and the men heard it. One of them
noted the spot from which the song proceeded and
at night, after the conflict, he went back to look for
the singer.</p>
<p>All was quiet as this Highlander wandered backward
and forward and it seemed as though his
quest would be futile. He then raised his voice and
called out: &ldquo;Sing it again, laddie, sing it again.&rdquo;
The laddie heard and responded and sang on till
the searcher found him and carried him back to the
base. In due course he returned home wounded but
thankful that He had not slumbered who kept him.</p>
<p class="tb">The higher unity of faith carries further than
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
the discordant notes of mere nationalism. This was
illustrated by a writer in the Kansas City <i>Times</i>,
relating the experience of</p>
<h3><span class="sc">A Violinist in the Trenches</span></h3>
<p>Outside of the dugout, shells whined and machine
guns spattered with a staccato of rat-tat-tats.
Inside a violin sang and sobbed. The magic of its
music made men forget. They forgot the homesickness.
They forgot the mud. They forgot the cold.
They forgot the ever presence of danger and death.</p>
<p>They listened, heads propped up on sand bags
and feet wrapped in blankets as they stretched on
mattresses of sand bags covering the rough planks
of their underground cots.</p>
<p>In another dugout, across No Man&rsquo;s Land on the
German side, others were also listening. They
heard the strains of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Spring Song,&rdquo;
as sweet and gentle and refreshing as an early summer
shower. A strange thing happened. A German
picked up a cornet, and floating to the Allies&rsquo; dugout
came the notes of the horn harmonizing with
the violin.</p>

<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Heard Within Prison Walls</i></span></h2>
<p>Some of the world&rsquo;s greatest books were written in
prison. Think of the Epistles of St. Paul which
came from such secluded confines. <i>The Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress</i>, which has been translated into more languages
than any other book except the Bible, was
written by Bunyan in Bedford Jail. Silvio Pellico,
an Italian man of letters, recounted his ten years
of imprisonment at Spielberg, Austria, and declared
that religion was his chief consolation. The
singing of St. Paul and Silas during their imprisonment
at Philippi had memorable results. There are
many other instances of beneficial consequences in
connection with these dismal incarcerations.</p>
<p>The incidents in this chapter have to do with the
influences upon the prisoners themselves and how
they were converted to Christ and comforted in
their distress. Such transcripts of life under inconceivably
trying circumstances give evidence of the
power of the Gospel. One of the most remarkable
recent books is entitled <i>A Gentleman in Prison</i>,
giving the experiences of Tokichi Ishii, a converted
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
Japanese criminal, who was executed in due course
for murder.</p>
<p class="tb">The first one tells how</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Prisoners Sang &ldquo;The Glory Song&rdquo;</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;The Glory Song&rdquo; attained a marvelous popularity
soon after it was published in 1900. In less
than five years it was being sung in many languages
all over the world. Several interesting incidents
are related of its influence but one that
Homer Rodeheaver wrote in <i>Zion&rsquo;s Herald</i>, Boston,
is worthy of note:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard it in a number of instances sung
by over ten thousand people, but the most impressive
rendering I ever heard given to it was by
a certain audience of over one thousand men. These
men were all dressed in steel gray suits, and sat
with folded arms; the man who played the organ
and the man who held the baton and led the song
were dressed in exactly the same way. Down the
right side, across the rear and up the left side of
the chapel room, on high stools, sat a row of men
in blue uniforms, holding heavy canes across their
knees, these men seemed never for an instant to
take their eyes from certain spots in front of them.
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
Not a man whispered during the service&mdash;for it
was a state&rsquo;s prison. Among the congregation of
1077 men, 256 were there for life&mdash;there to live
and die&mdash;and on each of their cell doors, where
they would read it every time they left and re-entered,
was that startling word &lsquo;Life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strangely their voices impressed me&mdash;these
men without a country, without a home, without
a name, deprived of every privilege accorded
to all men by the Almighty, and known only by
a number. As I sat before them, the prison pallor
of their faces against its background of gray within
that frame of blue, made a picture never to be forgotten.
With few exceptions, every man sang. Here
sat one with downcast eyes, there another with
mute lips, while yonder near the center a large,
strong fellow was weeping like a little child&mdash;but
silently. They told me he had been there but a
short time, and I wondered if he had heard the
song before, under different circumstances&mdash;and
where, for he had a kindly face. Softly they sang
that last stanza:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Friends will be there I have loved long ago;</p>
<p class="t0">Joys like a river around me will flow;</p>
<p class="t0">Yet, just a smile from my Saviour, I know,</p>
<p class="t0">Will through the ages be glory for me.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>The song ended, the chaplain said a brief prayer,
and that great crowd of men, at signals from the
guards in blue, marched out squad by squad, keeping
step to the music of the organ played by the
man in gray.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Their deepest feelings are portrayed in</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Hymn of the Prisoner</span></h3>
<p>Describing a chapel service in Auburn (New
York) prison, a newspaper correspondent wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the hymns the men sang was &lsquo;Pardon
the Debt and Make Me Free.&rsquo; They sang that over
and over again, and it seemed to express the feelings
of every convict.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The extraordinary circumstances in which a hymn
was used are described in this incident when</p>
<h3><span class="sc">A Condemned Man Wanted &ldquo;Face to Face&rdquo; Sung</span></h3>
<p>The story of the writings of Mrs. Carrie Ellis
Breck, who spent her girlhood days on her father&rsquo;s
fruit farm in New Jersey, was related by A. L.
Lawson in <i>The Christian Herald</i>. From that article
the following is taken:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the experience that touched her most
deeply of all, and the one she most treasures, is that
of the time when a poor condemned man, sentenced
to be hanged, asked that her hymn, &lsquo;Face to Face
with Christ My Saviour,&rsquo; be sung before his execution.
As the doomed wretch was led out, and looked
for the last time upon what was left him of the
world, there came to him the sweet words of her
hymn&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Face to face with Christ my Saviour,</p>
<p class="t">Face to face, how can it be,</p>
<p class="t0">When with rapture I behold Him,</p>
<p class="t">Jesus Christ, Who died for me?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Face to face shall I behold Him</p>
<p class="t">Far beyond the starry sky;</p>
<p class="t0">Face to face in all His glory,</p>
<p class="t">I shall see Him by and by!&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a></p>
</div>
<p class="tb">The pathos of the situation is recounted by a
prison chaplain in England who tells of</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Hymns Selected by Prisoners</span></h3>
<p>This chaplain, the Rev. G. A. Metcalfe, found
men confined for various crimes. One was convicted
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
of murder, but his sentence of death had been commuted
to penal servitude. During the first service
this murderer sat alone on the front seat. &ldquo;There
were hardened criminals behind, and here and
there some mothers&rsquo; lads with fine faces and soulful
eyes glistening with tears.&rdquo; After his address
he asked the prisoners to select two or three hymns.
One was &ldquo;Jesus Is Tenderly Calling&rdquo; and they
sang it with the utmost fervor. Then a young fellow
called out his choice and there was a sob in the
voices as they sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Holy Father, in Thy mercy,</p>
<p class="t">Hear our anxious prayer:</p>
<p class="t0">Keep our loved ones, now far absent,</p>
<p class="t">&rsquo;Neath Thy care.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">An experience of the days before prohibition
was recorded in <i>The Youth&rsquo;s Companion</i>, when</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Judge and Criminals Listened To &ldquo;The Holy City&rdquo;</span></h3>
<p>Thirty men, red-eyed and disheveled, lined up
before a judge of the San Francisco police court.
It was the regular morning company of &ldquo;drunks
and disorderlies.&rdquo; Just as the momentary disorder
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
attending the bringing in of the prisoners quieted
down, a strange thing happened. A strong, clear
voice from below began singing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Last night I lay a-sleeping,</p>
<p class="t0">There came a dream so fair.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Last night! It had been for them all a nightmare
or a drunken stupor. The song was such a
contrast to the horrible fact that no one could fail of
a sudden shock at the thought the song suggested.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I stood in old Jerusalem,</p>
<p class="t0">Beside the temple there,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>the song went on. The judge had paused. He made
a quiet inquiry. A former member of a famous
opera company, known all over the country, was
awaiting trial for forgery. It was he who was singing
in his cell.</p>
<p>Meantime the song went on, and every man on
the line showed emotion. At length, one man protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judge,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;have we got to submit to
this? We&rsquo;re here to take our punishment, but
this&mdash;&rdquo; and he began to sob.</p>
<p>It was impossible to proceed with the business of
the court, yet the judge gave no order to stop the
song. It moved on to its climax:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>

<p>In an ecstasy of melody the last words rang out,
and then there was silence.</p>
<p>The judge looked into the faces of the men before
him. There was not one who was not touched
by the song; not one in whom some better impulse
was not stirred. He did not call the cases singly&mdash;a
kind word of advice, and he dismissed them all.
No man was fined or sentenced to the workhouse
that morning. The song had done more good than
punishment could have accomplished.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>The Music of Submerged Lives</i></span></h2>
<p>Hope is the great gift of Christianity. It pierces
through the darkness and rejoices in the light beyond.
It looks through the cloud and is assured
that the sun is shining in the heavens. It insists on
looking at the bright side even when it knows that
there is a dark side. The English artist, George
Frederick Watts, painted Hope as a blindfolded
figure sitting on the top of a globe above a yawning
abyss, playing upon a lyre with only one string,
in harmony with the music of the Evangel, while
in the distance a star is shining. Fanny Crosby, the
blind hymn writer who died at the age of ninety-four,
once said: &ldquo;Hope&rsquo;s star shines clearer on my
pathway today than it did fifty years ago.&rdquo; It is
this same spirit of hope which Gilmour of Mongolia
had when he declared that the future is as
bright as the promises of God.</p>
<p>So long as we are thus inspired we cannot be
soured by cynicism, because we are sweetened by
the confidence which insists that &ldquo;the day must
dawn and darksome night be past.&rdquo; This is the
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
triumph of lives handicapped by harsh circumstances
but rising above what would submerge them
because of their assurance that hope is the anchor
of their soul, sure and steadfast. Here are some
illustrations of this truth from unexpected quarters.</p>
<p class="tb">A letter giving the impression of a radio service
by Dr. S. Parkes Cadman tells how</p>
<h3><span class="sc">A Cripple Stood on Crutches</span></h3>
<p>The writer related that he was greatly stirred by
the singing of</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Stand up, stand up for Jesus!</p>
<p class="t0">Ye soldiers of the cross.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>He then added: &ldquo;I have been on crutches for
more than twelve years but today when you sang

<p>&ldquo;Adah Vachell of Bristol&rdquo; is the story of a
brave, gifted, delicate lady who devoted her life to
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
the blind, deaf, crippled poor of the city of Bristol.
Her contact with the maimed and halt was made in
the ceaseless round of slum visitation, dens of filth
and want, sometimes revealing a brave endeavor to
triumph over adverse conditions.</p>
<p>A guild was formed with a startling motto,
<i>L&aelig;tus sorte mea</i>, &ldquo;Happy is my lot.&rdquo; Indissolubly
linked with it was the tug of war hymn, &ldquo;The Son
of God Goes Forth to War.&rdquo; &ldquo;I can picture him so
well, sitting close to the fire ... the wooden leg
stretched out, his rough rugged old face softened
as he sang in husky voice:</p>

</div>
<p class="tb">Here is a story of a famous hymn which was</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Sung for the Scrub Woman</span></h3>
<p>While the choir was waiting for the delayed organist,
a celebrated soprano recounted one of her
experiences. She said: &ldquo;I have sung before all the
greatest folk in America. I sang before a company
of titled folks from Europe who were visiting here
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
in this country. But the greatest thrill I ever got in
my life was singing before one lone woman, and
she a scrubwoman.&rdquo; &ldquo;Tell us about it,&rdquo; said the
tenor. &ldquo;We were getting ready for a great musical
event, and had been in the church rehearsing. As I
passed out on my way home, the scrubwoman, with
duster in hand, stopped me and said, &lsquo;Lady, you
sing so beautifully&mdash;I wonder if some day you
would sing &ldquo;Face to Face&rdquo; for me,&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t asking
too much, is it, lady?&rsquo; I told her I would be glad to
do so some day. When I got to the doorstep something
said to me, &lsquo;Do it now,&rsquo; so I turned back.
The organist was still there, and I asked him to
play. When the scrubwoman heard the strains of
the organ on the familiar tune, she came into the
church and sat on the very front seat with the
duster in her lap, and her eyes intensely upon me
with a strange light in them. I never had such a
thrill in all my life of song. I never felt so lifted
up, for there in that front seat sat the Lord Jesus
Himself listening to me sing to Him.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;And I shall see Him face to face</p>
<p class="t0">And tell the story&mdash;Saved by grace.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h3><span class="sc">What the Washerwoman Sang</span></h3>
<p>During his early ministry, Bishop William Burt
was a pastor in Brooklyn. From that period he carried
the memory of a woman who earned her living
by taking in washing. Sometimes when making his
round of pastoral calls the young pastor would
hear the woman, as she was working at her daily
task at the washtub, singing snatches of hymns
which were used at the services of the church and
the prayer meeting. But one which particularly
impressed him was the day when he was approaching
her humble rooms and heard her voice, as
she sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the child of a King.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Assurance was in her voice, and there was a note
of triumphant certainty on the part of this humble
daughter of toil that she was the King&rsquo;s child, and
therefore heir to all the promises made in the Bible.</p>
<p>Billy Bray, the Cornish miner, had the same
happy consciousness. Frequently he would exclaim,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the King&rsquo;s son!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The ability to rise above depressing circumstances
is seen in this incident</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<h3><span class="sc">Before Worship</span></h3>
<p>A few had gathered at the Goodwill Chapel
service fifteen minutes before the time to begin.
The leader often allowed his audience to select the
opening hymn. And these early comers were making
their choices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a hymn I like,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s &lsquo;We&rsquo;re
Marching to Zion.&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;I like it, too,&rdquo; said another,
&ldquo;but why do you like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the first speaker, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
nothing uncertain about that hymn. It knows where
it&rsquo;s going. A person can stand a whole lot of hardship
if she knows the end is worth it. Yes, I like
that hymn. If Mr. Dawson asks us what we want
to sing, this morning, I am going to ask for this
one.&rdquo; And so they talked happily among themselves.</p>
<p>Others came in and took their seats, a motley
company of depressed old age wearing the marks
of poverty and sorrow. The leader entered and this
time he gave out the hymn. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. I like
this just as well,&rdquo; observed the one who had chosen
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re Marching to Zion.&rdquo; Well might she and
the others, for it expressed faith and hope in the
lines:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Be not dismayed whate&rsquo;er betide,</p>
<p class="t">God will take care of you;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p class="t0">Beneath his wings of love abide,</p>
<p class="t">God will take care of you.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a></p>

<p>Thus encouraged they went from that service to
the humdrum routine of daily drudgery.</p>
<p class="tb">The power of the Gospel to reach those on the
outskirts of civilization is evidenced</p>
<h3><span class="sc">When Lumberjacks Sang &ldquo;Jesus, Lover of My Soul&rdquo;</span></h3>
<p>Thomas D. Whittles tells of many an interesting
incident in his book, <i>The Parish of the Pines</i><a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a>&mdash;the
story of Frank Higgins, the Lumberjacks&rsquo;
Sky Pilot.</p>
<p>One morning after breakfast the men went to
the bunkhouse to wait for the word of the &ldquo;push&rdquo;
ordering them to &ldquo;the works.&rdquo; While they waited
a rich tenor struck up the hymn,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Jesus, Lover of my soul,</p>
<p class="t0">Let me to Thy bosom fly!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>One by one the men joined in and the solo
passed into the chorus of a hundred voices. Out
through the twilight the melody rolled, waking
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
the sleeping pines, crossing the frozen lakes. The
men in the stables, harnessing their horses, heard
the song and softly whistled it; the cook, busy with
the pots and pans, hummed it in unison and the
swearing cookee closed his profane mouth and listened
in astonished silence. Over in the office where
the officials slept, the song caused silent amazement,
for it was unlike the morning hour when
oaths and curses break the stillness.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Other refuge have I none;</p>
<p class="t0">Hangs my helpless soul on Thee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>sang the men, unconscious of aught save the song.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Leave, ah! leave me not alone&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>and it came from the hearts of those who knew the
weight of lonely weeks and months. The Sky Pilot
in the office turned his face to the wall and prayed
while they sang this hymn which the men had sung
at the service the night before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All out,&rdquo; cried the &ldquo;push.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the shack streamed forth the men, singing
the song of comfort. Into groups they separated,
each going his appointed way, but the hymn continued
in all parts of the forest until the sweet
melody died to tender murmurs and was lost in the
distant evergreens. In all that North Star State no
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
happier body of men went forth to toil, for with
them went the spirit of song.</p>
<p class="tb">Here is an instance of gratitude expressively
shown in the words,</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Pass It On</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Henry Burton&rsquo;s famous hymn, &ldquo;Pass It On,&rdquo;
was inspired by a story relating to the early life of
the Rev. Mark Guy Pearse, noted as a preacher
and a writer, and who died just a few months
before Dr. Burton. The latter married a sister of
Mr. Pearse. How he came to write this hymn was
related in <i>The British Weekly</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Returning from school in Holland, Pearse
once found himself on a steam packet bound from
Bristol to Hayle in Cornwall, having had a hearty
supper, and later finding that he had reached the
limit of his finances. The steward was inclined to
be severe, but on hearing the lad&rsquo;s name he changed
his tone. Pearse&rsquo;s father had recently helped the
steward&rsquo;s mother in a difficulty, now the opportunity
had come for the old debt to be repaid. The
steward paid the supper bill with the remark, &lsquo;Now
pass this on to some one else.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This furnished the inspiration for the appealing
lines:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>

<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Songs of Salvation</i></span></h2>
<p>It has been rightly observed that the three ideas
most frequently expressed by Jesus are translated
by the words lost, last, least. He constantly repeated
the message that the lost shall be found, that the
last shall be the first, that the least shall be the
greatest. This is the Gospel of the World&rsquo;s Saviour
who saw possibilities in what others called hopeless
lives. He appealed to what was latent in them and
secured a response from the despised, the outcast,
the depraved. To all appearances they were incapable
of better things but Jesus knew better and He
was not disappointed.</p>
<p>These unfortunate individuals belong to the
&ldquo;broken earthenware&rdquo; of humanity. Scarred by sin,
hurt by temptation, haunted by fear, torn by passion,
repressed by prejudice, their lives have been
redeemed by the Saviour, and transformed. So
much so that their present has not the slightest
resemblance to their past, and their future has the
glow of greater progress toward holiness and happiness.
As long as such results are obtained by the
Gospel it is certainly good news to all classes and
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
conditions, and should be broadcast to earth&rsquo;s remotest
bounds. Here are some recent proofs of the
glory of the divine grace.</p>
<p class="tb">There are no hopeless cases as seen in the instance
of one who was</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Saved by Sankey&rsquo;s Singing</span></h3>
<p>Mrs. Emily Sullivan Oakey was a well-known
writer but she is best remembered by her hymn,
&ldquo;Sowing the Seed by the Daylight Fair.&rdquo; In the
winter of 1876, W. O. Lattimore, who had been
separated from his wife and child by drink and had
become a miserable drunkard, stumbled in an intoxicated
condition into Moody&rsquo;s Tabernacle in
Chicago. When he came to, he realized his mistake
and was about to leave when Sankey&rsquo;s solo held
him. He was singing the stanza:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Sowing the seed of a lingering pain,</p>
<p class="t0">Sowing the seed of a maddened brain,</p>
<p class="t0">Sowing the seed of a tarnished name,</p>
<p class="t0">Sowing the seed of eternal shame:</p>
<p class="t2">O, what shall the harvest be?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>These lines followed Lattimore even to the saloon
and he returned to the Tabernacle and was
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
converted. He went back to his family, engaged in
active work at the Moody meetings, accepted the
call to the ministry and was pastor of a flourishing
church in Evanston, Illinois, for twenty years.</p>
<p>This hymn was doubtless suggested by the Apostle&rsquo;s
words: &ldquo;Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall
he also reap.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The insight of Jesus is finely illustrated by</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Hymns from the Bowery Mission</span></h3>
<p>Fanny Crosby was a friend and devoted worker
at the Bowery Mission for several years and many
of her hymns were inspired by experiences at this
center of aggressive evangelism. Few hymns by
any writer show deeper sympathetic insight than
&ldquo;Rescue the Perishing,&rdquo; especially the lines:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t4">&ldquo;Down in the human heart,</p>
<p class="t4">Crushed by the tempter,</p>
<p class="t0">Feelings lie buried that grace can restore:</p>
<p class="t4">Touched by a loving heart,</p>
<p class="t4">Wakened by kindness,</p>
<p class="t0">Chords that were broken will vibrate once more.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The circumstances under which this hymn was
written are worth recounting in her own words:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;I recall the period of more than sixteen years
ago when it was my privilege to be a humble
worker in the Bowery Mission. The world is still,
and I am holding communion with the past; sweet,
hallowed communion, carrying me back to the fervent
heartfelt testimonies of those who, evening
after evening, told of the peace flowing like a river
which had entered their stained lives, had washed
away their sins, and made them clean through the
precious blood of our Lord&rsquo;s atonement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One evening a man for whom we had been
praying, said, his face radiant with joy, &lsquo;Now I can
meet mother in heaven, for I have found her God.&rsquo;
That night I wrote my hymn, &lsquo;Rescue the Perishing.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Here is a remarkable case of one who, while</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Singing of Christ, She Accepted Him</span></h3>
<p>In the absence of the organist at East Northfield,
Massachusetts, at one of the meetings during
the summer gathering, a woman stepped forward
and volunteered her services. She made a deep impression
by her playing and also by the sweetness
of her singing, with the result that she was in constant
demand at the other services. When urgently
requested she related her experience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>She used to be one of the leading singers of New
York, going from place to place, singing classical
and operatic music, but hymns she disliked. One
evening, while attending a mission service, she was
invited to sing a solo, which she did with pleasure.
Then someone asked her to sing a Gospel hymn.
She first laughed at the idea, and refused. Later
she consented. Opening the book at random, she
began:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;My Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine;</p>
<p class="t0">For Thee all the follies of sin I resign.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The words caused her to think of her past life.
She continued:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll love Thee in life, I will love Thee in death,</p>
<p class="t0">And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>These words struck her forcefully, and she
began to wonder if she really meant them. The
last verse followed:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;In mansions of glory and endless delight</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright;</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ll sing with the glittering crown on my brow,</p>
<p class="t0">If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, &rsquo;tis now.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It was enough. She arose from her seat at the
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
organ a Christian woman, and henceforth served
Christ whole-heartedly.</p>
<p class="tb">The initiative is always taken by God, as seen in
the story where</p>
<h3><span class="sc">God Was the Seeker</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;How long since ye sought and found God,
Jamie?&rdquo; said some of the friends of an old Scotch
elder as he lay dying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Robin, Robin, I never sought and found
him,&rdquo; answered the dying man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, his mind is gane, and he will never recognize
us again,&rdquo; remarked the friend sadly.</p>
<p>But the old saint opened his lips, and faintly
said: &ldquo;Listen! Not I&mdash;not I&mdash;I never sought
Him:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Jesus sought me when a stranger,</p>
<p class="t">Wandering from the fold of God,</p>
<p class="t0">He, to rescue me from danger,</p>
<p class="t">Interposed His precious blood.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The old Scotchman had grasped the fundamental
fact of Christianity, that Christ came to seek and
to save the lost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p class="tb">Dr. Charles A. Blanchard once related the conversion
of a friend of his through</p>
<h3><span class="sc">A Song at Midnight</span></h3>
<p>This friend was for many years an infidel, a
hard drinker, a Sabbath breaker, unkind to his wife.
One day, after a debauch, he went out on a stringer
belonging to a wharf in process of building, drank
two bottles of whisky, and lay down on the stringer,
expecting to fall asleep, and roll over into the
water in his sleep. He wanted to end his miserable
existence, but had not the courage to do it in any
other way. He did fall asleep, but did not turn
over, and awoke with the stars shining in his face.
He went home at midnight, saw his wife through
the window still at work ironing, and heard her
singing, &ldquo;What a Friend we have in Jesus.&rdquo; The
thought came to him, &ldquo;If Jesus can make my wife
sing at midnight, He can make me stop drinking
whiskey.&rdquo; He never touched a drop of intoxicating
liquor after that, and he became a sincere, trusting
Christian.</p>
<p class="tb">The truth of the words, &ldquo;Cast thy bread upon
the waters and thou shalt find it after many days,&rdquo;
finds an illustration in this story of a writer who was</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<h3><span class="sc">Handed a Copy of Her Own Hymn</span></h3>
<p>Charlotte Elliott first published her famous hymn,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Just as I am, without one plea</p>
<p class="t0">But that Thy blood was shed for me,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>in a volume entitled <i>The Invalid&rsquo;s Hymn Book</i>.
The sister of the author related this incident:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lady was so struck with it that she had it
printed as a leaflet and widely circulated without any
idea by whom it was composed. It happened
rather curiously that while we were living at Torquay,
our valued Christian physician came to us one
morning, having in his hand this leaflet. He
offered it to my sister, saying, &lsquo;I am sure this will
please you;&rsquo; and great indeed was his astonishment
on finding that it was written by herself, though by
what means it had been thus printed and circulated
she was utterly ignorant. Shortly after we became
acquainted with the lady who had printed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Mr. Sankey saved many hymns from obscurity
by singing them at the Moody meetings. Here is
the story of</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Throw Out the Lifeline</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>This hymn and the tune were written by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
Rev. E. S. Ufford of Springfield, Massachusetts,
although it was greatly popularized by Mr. Sankey&rsquo;s
singing of it with such signal results. Mr.
Ufford relates that he lived for many years near
the seashore in a little village thirteen miles from
Boston. In the summer he would often stroll along
the beach and see an old wreck half hidden in the
sands and rubbish and wonder whether such a wreck
might have been avoided if a life line had been
thrown out to the passengers and crew. He wished
that he might write a hymn with a searching message.
After a meeting held on the sands by the old
wreck, he offered the help of the Gospel to the
wrecks of manhood who were present.</p>
<p>The inspiration of this service so stirred him that
he sat down and in fifteen minutes wrote four stanzas
of the hymn which has justly become famous.
Sankey got hold of this hymn and at once began to
sing it. It was Moody&rsquo;s favorite. When Mr. Ufford
later took a trip round the world the fact that he
was the author of this hymn gave him a welcome
everywhere. It was his privilege to hear it sung by
the natives of Honolulu in their own tongue.</p>
<p class="tb">Mr. Sankey also popularized another hymn
which he casually came across</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<h3><span class="sc">In a Newspaper</span></h3>
<p>It was in 1874 that he discovered &ldquo;The Ninety
and Nine&rdquo; in a weekly newspaper which he bought at
the Glasgow railway station. He cut out this poem,
hoping to use it if he could get a suitable tune.
After an address on &ldquo;The Good Shepherd,&rdquo; Mr.
Moody turned to him with the request for an appropriate
solo. To quote his own words: &ldquo;At this
moment I seemed to hear a voice saying, &lsquo;Sing the
hymn you found in the train.&rsquo; I thought this impossible
as no music had been written for the hymn.
Again the impression came strongly upon me that I
must sing the beautiful appropriate words I had
found the day before, and placing the little newspaper
slip on the organ, I lifted my heart in prayer,
asking God to help me to sing that the people
might hear and understand. Laying my hands on
the organ, I struck the chord of A flat and began
the song. Note by note the tune was given, which
has not been changed from that day to this. Mr.
Moody was greatly moved. Leaning over the organ,
he looked at the little newspaper slip, and with
tears in his eyes said, &lsquo;Sankey, where did you get
that hymn? I never heard the like of it in my life.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This hymn was written by Miss Elizabeth C.
Clephane of Melrose, Scotland, who died in 1869.
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
Her sister was present at this noon meeting at the
Free Assembly Hall, and later wrote to Mr. Sankey,
thanking him for singing the hymn.</p>
<p class="tb">Here is another story by Andrew Stewart in <i>The
British Weekly</i> about these same meetings and how
the hymn</p>
<h3><span class="sc">&ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth&rdquo; Made an Extraordinary Impression</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;I remember Mr. Sankey in Edinburgh in 1874.
Mr. Moody and he were conducting meetings in
Broughton Place Church. It was their first visit to
Scotland, and Dr. Andrew Thomson had bravely
opened the great church to the strangers. A small
boy, sitting in our family pew, facing the pulpit, I
can recall the effect of the great crowds and the intense
impression. One of the hymns used was &lsquo;Jesus
of Nazareth Passeth By.&rsquo; My father told long
afterwards how he met a commercial traveler one
morning on the ferry steamer that crossed from
Granton before the Forth Bridge was built. The
traveler spoke of having attended the evangelistic
services the previous night. He said: &lsquo;I am not a religious
man and not easily moved, but when that
man sang &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth Has Passed By&rdquo; it
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
made an extraordinary impression on me.&rsquo; The fact
is that the success of the evangelists had more connection
with Sankey&rsquo;s singing than most people realize.
He had a powerful baritone voice and sang
with deep feeling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first verse of the hymn is:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;What means this eager, anxious throng,</p>
<p class="t0">Which moves with busy haste along&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">These wondrous gath&rsquo;rings day by day,</p>
<p class="t0">What means this strange commotion, pray?</p>
<p class="t0">In accents hushed the throng reply,</p>
<p class="t">&lsquo;Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">From far-off China comes this striking incident
in connection with</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">One Sweetly Solemn Thought</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Dr. Russell H. Conwell was traveling in China
and one day he entered a gambling house in a
Chinese city. Two Americans were there, betting
and drinking; the older one frequently using the
filthiest profanity. The younger man had lost in
two games and the third game had just begun.
While the winner was shuffling the cards his companion
sat lazily back in his chair. There was delay
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
in dealing out the cards and while waiting, the
other looked carelessly about the room and began
to hum a tune and then to sing almost unconsciously.
The words were:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;One sweetly solemn thought</p>
<p class="t">Comes to me o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er;</p>
<p class="t0">I am nearer home today</p>
<p class="t">Than I ever have been before.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>While the young man sang, his fellow gambler
stopped dealing out cards, stared at the singer and
exclaimed: &ldquo;Harry, where did you learn that
song?&rdquo; &ldquo;What song?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, the one you have
been singing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said he did not know what he had been singing.
The other repeated the words, with tears in his
eyes, and the younger man said he had learned
them in the Sunday School in America.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the elder gambler, getting up;
&ldquo;come, Harry, here&rsquo;s what I have won from you;
go and use it for some good purpose. As for me, as
God sees me, I have played my last game and drunk
my last bottle. I have misled you, Harry, and I
am sorry. Give me your hand, my boy, and say
that for old America&rsquo;s sake, if for no other, you
will quit this infernal business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This hymn was written by Miss Phoebe Cary
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
while visiting a friend. She had attended church
and was deeply stirred, and on returning to her
friend&rsquo;s house she retired to &ldquo;the little back third-story
bedroom&rdquo; and wrote this expression of her
experience. This incident in China gave her much
happiness. After her death the older man in the
above story wrote to Dr. Conwell saying that he
was now a &ldquo;hard working Christian&rdquo; and that
Harry had renounced his evil ways.</p>

<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">&ldquo;<i>The Old Rugged Cross</i>&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>The Cross is the triumphant symbol of a militant
and puissant Christianity. It tells of &ldquo;love divine,
all loves excelling.&rdquo; It sustains hope in the final
victory of good. It establishes faith in the persistent
reality of truth. The Gospel of the Cross proclaims
redemption from sin, reconciliation with God, realization
of goodwill to all people. There is absolutely
nothing else to equal the appeal of the Cross
in its power to produce the most desirable changes
in the individual and in society. Wherever it has
been preached with the conviction of experience
and the constraint of passion, the Holy Christ has
won trophies in lives recovered from the waste of
sin, renewed by the power of grace, enriched by the
practices of purity and peace.</p>
<p>Indeed, the only cure for our distracted age is
found in the Atoning Christ. This is endorsed by
the voices of redeemed multitudes of every age
and land. The testimony from life is conclusive. It
holds us by a resolute determination to announce its
message of pardon and joy to everyone. In the
words of John Oxenham,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Love, with the lifted hands and thorn-crowned head;</p>
<p class="t0">Still conquers death, though life itself be fled,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t4">His Cross still stands!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Yes,&mdash;Love triumphant stands, and stands for more,</p>
<p class="t0">In our great need, than e&rsquo;er it stood before!</p>
<p class="t4">His Cross still stands!&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a></p>

<h3><span class="sc">All Wanted the Same Song</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;I was in a radio studio, the other night, listening
to the broadcast of a program. Naturally I was
interested. Interested in what the performers did
and how they were handled and the precision with
which the timing was accomplished. But the one
thing that interested me more than the actual happenings
in the studio, was something quite apart
from the especial broadcast that was taking place.
For, as I sat there, I was conscious of a great flurry
going on in an outer office. I could see, as I sat
there, a constant stream of messenger boys&mdash;and I
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
was conscious of an equally constant answering of
telephones. I couldn&rsquo;t help feeling that some great
event was taking place&mdash;or was about to take place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so the moment that the broadcast was over,
I went into that outer office and began to ask questions.
&lsquo;Why the excitement?&rsquo; I asked of a pretty
stenographer. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen such a bustling
about.&rsquo; The girl smiled as she replied: &lsquo;A very
popular singer is going to broadcast tonight,&rsquo; she
told me, &lsquo;and people are sending in requests that
he sing their favorite song. Curiously enough, with
hardly an exception, it&rsquo;s the same song!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What song is it?&rsquo; I asked. And I was both
amazed and stirred to learn that the radio audience
was asking for one of the splendid old revival
hymns&mdash;&lsquo;The Old Rugged Cross!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,</p>
<p class="t0">The emblem of suff&rsquo;ring and shame;</p>
<p class="t0">And I love that old cross where the dearest and best</p>
<p class="t0">For a world of lost sinners was slain.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Gospel Music in the Lumber Camps</span></h3>
<p>An upturned barrel serves for pulpit, and a
horse blanket, bearing the manufacturer&rsquo;s name in
large letters, is the embroidered altar cloth. No
Genevan gown lends grace to the minister, but coatless
he stands&mdash;a shirt-sleeved messenger of God.</p>
<p>The opening of a service conducted by Frank
Higgins, the Sky Pilot, is thus described:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sing No. 31, boys; it&rsquo;s easy and it&rsquo;s a good
one. Let her go!&rsquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Alas! and did my Saviour bleed?</p>
<p class="t0">And did my Sovereign die?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The hymn is old and the boys welcome it
lustily. The music lacks in sweetness: in volume it
abounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You can do better. Hit it harder on the next
verse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do; they shout it forth in full voice,
pleased with the song, glad for the privilege of
singing. Then the chorus: &lsquo;At the cross, at the
cross, where I first saw the light,&rsquo; shakes the bunkhouse
and wanders over the far reaches of the
night-bound forest. In our fashionable churches,
trained voices blend in superb harmony; but this
is the music of songless lives.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><span class="sc">The Cross Remains</span></h3>
<p>Matthew Arnold was visiting his brother-in-law,
Mr. Cropper, and went with him to a service at
Seton Park Church, Liverpool, England. The minister,
Dr. John Watson (&ldquo;Ian Maclaren&rdquo;), preached
on &ldquo;The Shadow of the Cross,&rdquo; and the congregation
afterwards sang the familiar hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;When I survey the wondrous cross</p>
<p class="t0">On which the Prince of Glory died.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>At lunch that day Mr. Arnold referred to the
hymn, which he said he considered the finest in the
English language. Appreciative reference was also
made to the sermon; and the poet mentioned especially
an illustration which the preacher had drawn
from a Riviera earthquake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In one village,&rdquo; said Dr. Watson, &ldquo;the huge
crucifix above the altar, with a part of the chancel,
remained unshaken amid the ruins, and round the
cross the people sheltered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; remarked Arnold in speaking of this,
&ldquo;the cross remains, and in the straits of the soul
makes its ancient appeal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This recalls an incident mentioned in a lecture,
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
when the speaker described a scene in Paris in which
a number of men, when a cathedral was dedicated
on a hill, attempted to blot out the illumination of
the cross on the spire by raising large clouds of
smoke with chemicals. &ldquo;Instead of blotting it out,&rdquo;
said the lecturer, &ldquo;the cross stood out in greater
magnificence and splendor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never does the Cross fail men in their need; but</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;His cross like a far-seen beacon stands</p>
<p class="t">In the midst of a world of sin;</p>
<p class="t0">And stretched out are His bleeding hands</p>
<p class="t">To gather the wanderers in.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">The truth of reliance upon the Christ of the
Cross is well brought out in</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Rock of Ages</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>The original title of this hymn was &ldquo;A Living
and Dying Prayer for the Holiest Believer in the
World.&rdquo; But, as a matter of fact, the hymn is a
favorite of the best saint and the worst sinner. It
can be used appropriately in every condition of life.
In a shipwreck off the Bay of Biscay, the last man
who left the ship said he heard the passengers
singing,</p>
<div class="verse">

<p class="t0">Let me hide myself in Thee!&rdquo;</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Henry Drummond&rsquo;s Hymn on His Last Sunday</span></h3>
<p>Death called the brilliant Henry Drummond
hence while he was still in the prime of life. On
the afternoon of the last Sunday he spent on earth
this noble Scotchman, with his scientific mind and
evangelical spirit, heard his friend, Dr. Barbour,
play to him the music of the hymn, &ldquo;Art Thou
Weary, Art Thou Languid?&rdquo; and other hymn
tunes. There was no response. Then he tried the
old Scots melody of &ldquo;Martyrdom,&rdquo; to which
Drummond beat time with his hand, and joined in
the words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ashamed to own my Lord,</p>
<p class="t">Or to defend His cause;</p>
<p class="t0">Maintain the honor of His word,</p>
<p class="t">The glory of His cross.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>When they finished singing this hymn by Isaac
Watts, Drummond said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to beat
that, Hugh.&rdquo; The following Thursday he passed
to greet his Lord of whom he had been a radiant
follower.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p class="tb">The everlasting Gospel of the Cross is assuredly</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Only Word for Discord and Distress</span></h3>
<p>How truly it meets our needs is finely suggested
in one of the best hymns, &ldquo;My Faith Looks Up to
Thee.&rdquo; It was written by Dr. Ray Palmer at the
age of twenty-two while still a theological student,
suffering from poor health, laboring under many
discouragements and realizing that God was his
only help. During the Civil War some soldiers met
in a tent for prayer before a great battle; they decided
to draw up and sign a paper, expressing their
trust in that stern hour. One of the men knew this
hymn and he wrote it out and each man signed his
name. Only one of them lived through the battle
to tell of this death covenant and to send the precious
document to the loved ones of those who fell.
Well might each of them have prayed:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;My faith looks up to Thee,</p>
<p class="t0">Thou Lamb of Calvary,</p>
<p class="t2">Saviour divine!</p>
<p class="t0">Now hear me while I pray,</p>
<p class="t0">Take all my guilt away,</p>
<p class="t0">O let me from this day</p>
<p class="t2">Be wholly Thine!&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
of nationality or color, as is seen in this
incident about</p>
<h3><span class="sc">What Frances Wanted Sung</span></h3>
<p>Frances Phillips, a young girl of Alaska, was the
first pupil to graduate in the eighth grade in the
Training School at Sitka. Soon afterwards she married
a young man named Sam Johnson. Both were
Christians. Frances died in 1924, a few days after
the death of her little son. Dr. Samuel Hall Young
tells us that he had been going to see her daily for
a week when, on Sunday morning, word was
brought that she was dying. &ldquo;The little church was
not far distant, and Frances sent word to open the
doors and windows and to sing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;My hope is built on nothing less</p>
<p class="t0">Than Jesus&rsquo; blood and righteousness.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The dying woman joined feebly, with an ecstatic
smile on her wan face and soon passed away.
Before her death she had started a subscription in
Angoon to build a new church. Sam and his brothers
took up this work, and a beautiful little building
called &lsquo;The Frances Johnson Memorial Church&rsquo;
was erected, almost entirely by the Indians.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a></p>

<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Hymns of Youth</i></span></h2>
<p>The questioning attitude of youth is impelled by a
desire for deeper reality. Some of their words and
ways may scandalize the conventional, but back of
it all we find eager sincerity and animated purposefulness
to make life count for more. We need to
show the patience of confidence towards skeptical
young people. We must encourage them to work
out their problems not by holding up danger signals,
but by magnifying the ways of sure deliverance.
We are not wedded to methods but are inspired
by motives. So long as these latter are right
we might well disagree about how they are to be
expressed.</p>
<p>An interesting sidelight on the essential loyalty
of young people was recently given when, at a
summer institute attended exclusively by them, a
popular vote was taken of the best ten hymns. The
following were named: &ldquo;Holy, Holy, Holy;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Nearer, My God, to Thee;&rdquo; &ldquo;Rock of Ages;&rdquo;
&ldquo;When I Survey the Wondrous Cross;&rdquo; &ldquo;Abide
With Me;&rdquo; &ldquo;Sweet Hour of Prayer;&rdquo; &ldquo;Jesus,
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
Lover of My Soul;&rdquo; &ldquo;O Love, That Wilt Not Let
Me Go;&rdquo; &ldquo;Just As I Am;&rdquo; &ldquo;Lead Kindly Light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is certainly not the choice of erratic radicals,
but of rational conservatives who desire to retain
what is best in the past while going forward with
characteristic adventuresomeness to new fields of
activity and of achievement.</p>
<p class="tb">The new program of religious education is an
attempt more satisfactorily to meet the needs of
children and adolescents. Previous efforts had their
limitations but all who grew up under the conditions
of the former generation will appreciate this
testimony from Sir Harry Lauder in <i>Roamin&rsquo; in
the Gloamin&rsquo;</i> about</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Influence of the Sunday School</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;I forget many of the hymns we sang at the
Band of Hope, but such favorites as &lsquo;Shall We
Gather at the River?&rsquo;, &lsquo;Throw Out the Life Line,&rsquo;
and similar haunting airs stand out in my memory.
I loved every note of them and yelled them out
most lustily. The old Scottish psalm tunes we occasionally
sang at the Band of Hope, and also at
the Sunday School I attended, likewise made an
extraordinary appeal to me. &lsquo;All People That On
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
Earth Do Dwell,&rsquo; to the tune of the &lsquo;Old Hundred;&rsquo;
&lsquo;O, God of Bethel by Whose Hand&rsquo; to the
tune of &lsquo;St. Kilda,&rsquo; were among my favorites. The
last mentioned melody is in a most unusual minor
key. It was written by a young Scottish musician
named Bloomfield, who died early in life and
whose body, I have been told, is lying in an ancient
cemetery in Aberdeen.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a></p>
<p class="tb">These words recall an experience of Captain John
Lauder in France, which led him to declare he was</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Glad He Learned the Hymn in Sunday School</span></h3>
<p>While convalescing in the hospital he went one
day to the piano and began playing very softly.
One of the nurses then came up to him and said a
Captain Webster of the Gordon Highlanders who
knew his father, Sir Harry, wanted to see him.
What followed had best be stated in his own words,
quoted in <i>A Minstrel in France</i><a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> by Harry Lauder:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man had gone through ten operations in
less than a week. I thought perhaps my playing had
disturbed him, but when I went to his bedside, he
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
grasped my hand, pressed it with what little
strength he had left, and thanked me. He asked
me if I could play a hymn. He said he would like
to hear &lsquo;Lead, Kindly Light.&rsquo; So I went back to
the piano and played it as softly and as gently as I
could. It was his last request. He died an hour
later. I was very glad I was able to soothe his last
moments a little. I am very glad that I learned the
hymn at Sunday School as a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Dr. R. J. Campbell tells a touching story about a
mother and her only child whose request was</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Sing, Muzzer, Sing</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>This young English mother made a living for
herself and child by singing in the concert halls of
London, and so at night she was compelled to leave
him while meeting her engagements. One night
she had a foreboding of evil but she had to keep
her appointment. The rapture of the crowds and
the encores were nothing to her as on this night she
hurried back to the lad. She took him up in her
arms and held him as if he could never slip away.
But he was dying, and his broken words were,
&ldquo;Sing, muzzer, sing.&rdquo; What an ordeal! But she
responded. Her clear sweet voice broke upon the
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
hush of that tenement room in the words of the
matchless hymn of the children:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I think when I read that sweet story of old,</p>
<p class="t">When Jesus was here among men;</p>
<p class="t0">How He called little children like lambs to His fold,</p>
<p class="t">I should like to have been with Him then.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Children Sang of the Love of Jesus</span></h3>
<p>A group of fresh-air children from New York
City were being entertained at East Northfield, the
home of the schools established by D. L. Moody.
One Sunday, sitting in a body in the great auditorium,
they were presented to the audience, and
then invited to the platform to sing for the assembled
company. The little folks marched to the
front of the building, faced the many hundreds of
people, and gleefully sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I am so glad that our Father in heaven</p>
<p class="t0">Tells of His love in the Book He has given,</p>
<p class="t0">Wonderful things in the Bible I see;</p>

<p>Children of parents who came from many different
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
nations across the Atlantic, living amid hard
conditions in the great city of New York, life had
not afforded them much in the form of pleasure.
But their faces fairly radiated happiness as they
lustily sang:</p>
<div class="verse">

<p class="t0">I am so glad that Jesus loves me, Jesus loves even me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In our city-visiting we soon discovered that the
first difficult plowing of the ground was being done
for us by the children. Everywhere we were welcomed,
and mothers, whom we had never seen, repeated
Scripture texts, hymns, and sentences of
prayer with surprising accuracy. One little fellow,
unconscious that he was being watched, walked
down the street singing at the top of his voice,
&ldquo;Dare to be a Daniel, dare to stand alone,&rdquo; then
coming to a stop before a peanut vendor and looking
him in the face, said, &ldquo;Did you <i>know</i> that there
is only one God, and one Lord Jesus Christ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said the man bewildered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it is true,&rdquo; answered the child, and passed
on singing, &ldquo;&lsquo;Dare to have a purpose firm, dare to
make it known.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

Sunday School Times</i> about</p>

<p>A Christian mother recently found no little difficulty
in leading her &rsquo;teen-age girls to overcome
the habit of singing jazz. It is what they heard over
the neighbor&rsquo;s radio, in school, on the street, everywhere.
And in order to cure the habit there seemed
to be need for something more than the negative
command, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sing such songs, girls!&rdquo; At
length she hit upon a solution to the problem.
When the girls burst into &ldquo;Carolina moon, keep
shining,&rdquo; the mother would begin, very quietly and
with apparent lack of purpose,</p>

from joining them, for the verse truthfully expressed

<h3><span class="sc">Evening Prayer of Young Campers</span></h3>
<p>The young people who had spent the evening
together were about to separate and go to their several
tents and cottages. &ldquo;Why not a song-prayer
together?&rdquo; asked one. The suggestion was favorably
received. These were the words they sang just
before they retired:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Glory to Thee, my God, this night,</p>
<p class="t0">For all the blessings of the light:</p>
<p class="t0">Keep me, O keep me, King of kings,</p>
<p class="t0">Beneath the shadow of Thy Wings.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Forgive me, Lord, for Thy dear Son,</p>
<p class="t0">The ill which I this day have done;</p>
<p class="t0">That with the world, myself, and Thee,</p>
<p class="t0">I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">. . . <span class="hst">. . .</span> <span class="hst">. . .</span></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O let my soul on Thee repose,</p>
<p class="t0">And may sweet sleep mine eyelids close;</p>
<p class="t0">Sleep which shall me more vigorous make,</p>
<p class="t0">To serve my God, when I awake.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">The culminating moment at a missionary meeting
was reached when the assembly sang a hymn,</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Acknowledging God&rsquo;s Claims</span></h3>
<p>It was at one of the anniversaries of the London
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
Missionary Society at Queen&rsquo;s Hall, London.
There were present a number of young men and
women who were about to leave for their several
mission fields. Instead of some modern hymns
which are convicted of false sentiment, there was
selected Doddridge&rsquo;s hymn for this notable occasion.
The first verse is:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;My gracious Lord, I own Thy right</p>
<p class="t">To every service I can pay,</p>
<p class="t0">And call it my supreme delight</p>
<p class="t">To hear Thy dictates and obey.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>One can imagine the enthusiasm of those prospective
missionaries as they sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis to my Saviour I would live</p>
<p class="t">To Him who for my ransom died;</p>
<p class="t0">Nor could all worldly honor give</p>
<p class="t">Such bliss as crowns me at His side.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">The courage of conviction was strikingly exhibited
in connection with a well-known chorus,</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Can the Lord Depend on You?</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Three thousand people had gathered in a beautiful
grove for the annual reunion of one of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
State societies of Los Angeles. The musical program
consisted of old sacred melodies with variations
and they were received with enthusiasm. The
president then announced that three young ladies
would perform a special dance and he requested
the pianist to play for the dancers. Much to his
surprise and chagrin a polite negative reply was
given. &ldquo;But there is no one else here to play for the
dance,&rdquo; said the president.</p>
<p>The pianist insisted on refusal, declaring that he
had never used his talent in that connection and
never so intended. The president then threatened to
expose him to the vast audience, and no sooner had
he done so than the pianist took the platform and
said: &ldquo;My reason for not playing for the dance is
that my talent is not my own. It is dedicated to a
far higher and nobler service. It is devoted wholly
to the service of Christ.&rdquo; The impression produced
upon the gathering had an effect different from
that of the president of this state society. On adjournment,
several got into conversation with the
pianist, which led to complete decisions for Christ.</p>
<p class="tb">The great heart of the nation was heard on a
notable occasion when, in a spirit of unity,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<h3><span class="sc">Young America Made Music</span></h3>
<p>This took place during the sessions of the National
Education Association at Dallas, Texas. It
was on the last evening of the convention, which
for five days had engaged in earnest discussion on
the education of children in the United States.</p>
<p>Five thousand persons applauded when the curtain
rose; and the spectators were thrilled when
they saw on the stage eight hundred boys and girls
dressed in pure white. These were the best singers
in the Dallas elementary schools. For an hour they
sang, never missing a word or a note, without a
scrap of paper before their eyes. The last third of
the program was the cantata of &ldquo;Rip Van Winkle,&rdquo;
which was rendered with a sweetness possible only
to the unspoiled voices of children who sing because
they love to sing.</p>
<p>The curtain rose the second time, and the scene
changed. The National High School Orchestra appeared
for the first time in history before the National
Education Association. Two hundred and
sixty-six boys and girls from thirty-nine states sat
there &ldquo;with their handsome instruments.&rdquo; They
were selected from six hundred who were competent
and anxious to attend. It was a thrilling sight
to watch these young people who sat together regardless
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
of the states from which they came, and
whose faces had &ldquo;the features of every nation
under heaven.&rdquo; The program was arranged to recreate
the moods of life&mdash;of play, heroism, questioning,
hope, despair, fantasy, and religious fervor.
The musical selections were from the masters,
and they were rendered with perfect harmony.</p>
<p>For two hours these young people stirred the
depths of their vast audience. It was like a glimpse
of the great scene described in the Bible, &ldquo;of the
company out of every nation and kindred and tribe
before the throne of God, whose anthem of praise
is like the sound of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The closing number was most impressive. Led
by the youthful orchestra, the audience sang the
evening hymn of Sabine Baring Gould:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Now the day is over,</p>
<p class="t">Night is drawing nigh,</p>
<p class="t0">Shadows of the evening</p>
<p class="t">Steal across the sky.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>So the music swept on until the closing stanza
was reached:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;When the morning wakens,</p>
<p class="t">Then may I arise</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p class="t0">Pure, and fresh, and sinless</p>
<p class="t">In Thy holy eyes.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This incident is fully described in <i>Yankee Notions</i>,
by Henry T. Bailey.<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a>
He concludes his
account with an impressive sentence: &ldquo;I heard the
great heart of my country singing as never before,
and the harmony was as rich and deep as human
brotherhood itself.&rdquo;</p>

by</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Hymns Used at the Dedication of a College Chapel</span></h3>
<p>Hendricks Memorial Chapel of Syracuse University
was dedicated on June 8, 1930. It is the
third in size of all college chapels in the United
States and is to be the center for the religious guidance
of the students.</p>
<p>The hymns used on this occasion were full of
significance. The first had a national application
and was written by a physician, Dr. Alfred A.
Woodhull. Six thousand voices blended in singing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Great God of nations, now to Thee</p>
<p class="t">Our hymn of gratitude we raise;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p class="t0">With humble heart and bending knee</p>
<p class="t">We offer Thee our song of praise.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This was followed by &ldquo;Faith of Our Fathers.&rdquo;
The closing hymn was written by Dr. M. W.
Stryker, one of the distinguished presidents of
Hamilton College:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Almighty Lord, with one accord,</p>
<p class="t">We offer Thee our youth.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>At the afternoon service of dedication the first
hymn was</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Glorious things of Thee are spoken</p>
<p class="t">Zion, City of our God.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The next was Professor Caleb T. Winchester&rsquo;s
striking hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The Lord our God alone is strong,</p>
<p class="t">His hands build not for one brief day;</p>
<p class="t0">His wondrous works, through ages long,</p>
<p class="t">His wisdom and His power display.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Deeply prayerful was the last stanza:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And let those learn, who here shall meet,</p>
<p class="t">True wisdom is with reverence crowned,</p>
<p class="t0">And science walks with humble feet</p>
<p class="t">To seek the God that faith hath found.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>The hymn of dedication was most appropriate.
It was written by William Cullen Bryant, who was
a student in Williams College. And it was from
occasional summer afternoons of meditation in the
chapel of this college that Senator Francis Hendricks
conceived the idea of providing this memorial
chapel for Syracuse University. Here are two
stanzas:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Thou, whose unmeasured temple stands,</p>
<p class="t">Built over earth and sea,</p>
<p class="t0">Accept the walls that human hands</p>
<p class="t">Have raised, O God, to Thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">. . . <span class="hst">. . .</span> <span class="hst">. . .</span></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">May faith grow firm, and love grow warm,</p>
<p class="t">And pure devotion rise,</p>
<p class="t0">While round these hallowed walls the storm</p>
<p class="t">Of earthborn passion dies.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>At night was held the installation service of the
Dean of Hendricks Chapel. It began with the immortal
hymn of Isaac Watts:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O God, our help in ages past,</p>
<p class="t">Our hope for years to come,</p>
<p class="t0">Our shelter from the stormy blast,</p>
<p class="t">And our eternal home!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The last hymn on that eventful day was one
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
which came from Dr. Washington Gladden, a man
who exercised a large influence in our national religious
life. The desires and hopes of all were thus
deeply expressed as they sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O Master, let me walk with Thee,</p>
<p class="t0">In lowly paths of service free;</p>
<p class="t0">Tell me Thy secret; help me bear</p>
<p class="t0">The strain of toil, the fret of care.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">. . . <span class="hst">. . .</span> <span class="hst">. . .</span></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In hope that sends a shining ray</p>
<p class="t0">Far down the future&rsquo;s broadening way;</p>
<p class="t0">In peace that only Thou canst give,</p>
<p class="t0">With Thee, O Master, let me live.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Hymns as Prayers</i></span></h2>
<p>When our feelings are deeply stirred by a crisis it
is the most natural thing to turn to God in prayer.
Such an acknowledgment of the divine resourcefulness
in the face of human helplessness advertises
the inherent dignity of man, who finds that he is
best able to overcome difficulties by reliance upon
God. Any person who is able to make such a contact
with the Source of Power through prayer is
well equipped for the tasks of life.</p>
<p>It is the filial spirit which inspires the tone and
quality of prayer, whereby we receive spiritual insight
and moral strength for duty. It has been well
said that &ldquo;prayer is the discipline of desire in the
light of the best consciousness of God that we can
attain unto.&rdquo; We must recover this practice of
prayer for right living. It will reinforce us with
virtue and vitality to keep true to our best selves
and fit us to meet every demand. It is in actual experience
and not by mere theorizing that we find
out the real efficacy of prayer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p class="tb">Bishop Edwin H. Hughes, in <i>The Pastor Looks
at His Work</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a> reports some of his experiences to
show that</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Hymns Are Prayers</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;A little while ago I was in a service where a
minister of no little eminence was suddenly called
on to pray. His response was simply the repeating
of the entire hymn, whose first stanza reads:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;My faith looks up to Thee,</p>
<p class="t0">Thou Lamb of Calvary,</p>
<p class="t2">Saviour Divine!</p>
<p class="t0">Now hear me while I pray,</p>
<p class="t0">Take all my guilt away,</p>
<p class="t0">Oh, let me from this day</p>
<p class="t2">Be wholly Thine!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>If one man&rsquo;s experience was typical, that individual
hymn with its &lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;My&rsquo; brought scores of people
into a spiritual aggregate and made a &lsquo;common
supplication.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much of the same thing happened in the bishops&rsquo;
meeting not so long ago. We were having a
prayer service, only that, and it must have continued
for two and a half hours. One bishop&rsquo;s
prayer that night was simply a repeating of Whittier&rsquo;s
hymn:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Dear Lord and Father of mankind,</p>
<p class="t">Forgive our feverish ways;</p>
<p class="t0">Reclothe us in our rightful mind,</p>
<p class="t0">In purer lives Thy service find,</p>
<p class="t">In deeper reverence, praise.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>As we were all on our knees we were led to treat
that hymn as a public prayer; and it was at once an
inspiring and exalting thing. Our services would be
enriched beyond measure if only this spirit of
prayer could be more definitely attached to the
songs of our corporate worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Here is a personal testimony from Fanny Crosby
concerning</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Constant Companion of the Pilgrim Journey</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;Toward the close of a day in the year 1874, I was
sitting in my room thinking of the nearness of God
through Christ as the constant companion of the
pilgrim journey, when my heart burst out with the
words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Thou my everlasting portion,</p>
<p class="t">More than friend or life to me,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p class="t0">All along my pilgrim journey,</p>
<p class="t">Saviour, let me walk with Thee.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">How prayer is the inevitable opening for guidance
is finely illustrated in the circumstances which
resulted in the writing of</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Lead, Kindly Light</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>This well-known hymn was written by John
Henry Newman when, as a young clergyman of
the Anglican Church, he lay sick and troubled in a
vessel which was becalmed in the Gulf of Palermo.
He was restless to return to England and
perplexed concerning the future. His feelings were
expressed on the afternoon of June 16, 1833, in
this prayer for guidance. The well-known tune,
&ldquo;Lux Benigna,&rdquo; to which it is usually sung, was
composed in 1865 by Dr. J. B. Dykes as he walked
through the crowded Strand in London. It was
done in ten minutes in what might seem to have
been an unfavorable place, and yet faith shows its
power in overcoming distractions and difficulties,
as was done by this musician.</p>
<p>The author of this hymn later entered the Roman
Catholic Church. He is best known as Cardinal
Newman but none of his writings, not even
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
his <i>Apologia Pro Vita Sua</i>, has exercised the influence
of this prayer hymn. To be sure, all who use
it have not been guided as was the cardinal. A
friend recently remarked to me: &ldquo;I was in the
habit of repeating these lines on board the ship
which was bringing me a stranger to the United
States. The assurance that the Light still will lead
me on has remained with me during the years nor
have I any reason to expect that it will be different
in the days to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Here is an experience about</p>
<h3><span class="sc">An Eventide Prayer</span></h3>
<p>A minister of long service and extensive travel
went into the church of a denomination other than
that to which he belonged when away from home,
for evening worship. He was deeply impressed
when the pastor offered as the evening prayer some
stanzas from a hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;At even, ere the sun was set,</p>
<p class="t">The sick, O Lord, around Thee lay;</p>
<p class="t0">O in what divers pain they met!</p>
<p class="t">O with what joy they went away!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Once more &rsquo;tis eventide, and we,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p class="t">Oppressed with various ills, draw near;</p>
<p class="t0">What if Thy form we cannot see?</p>
<p class="t">We know and feel that Thou are here.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Saviour Christ, our woes dispel;</p>
<p class="t">For some are sick, and some are sad,</p>
<p class="t0">And some have never loved Thee well,</p>
<p class="t">And some have lost the love they had.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">. . . <span class="hst">. . .</span> <span class="hst">. . .</span></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thy touch has still its ancient power,</p>
<p class="t">No word from Thee can fruitless fall;</p>
<p class="t0">Hear in this solemn evening hour,</p>
<p class="t">And in Thy mercy heal us all.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>No words other than those of the hymn were
spoken; but the visiting minister affirmed that he
never heard a more appropriate or appealing
prayer.</p>
<p class="tb">How calmness and poise are obtained are related
in an experience</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Through the Long Night Watches</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>A minister was once confined to bed by sickness.
When Sunday came he could hear the hymns which
the congregation sang, for the parsonage adjoined
the church. Evening found him feverish and restless,
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
but with soothing effect came the closing
hymn. Through the open window came the prayerful
lines:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Now the day is over,</p>
<p class="t">Night is drawing nigh;</p>
<p class="t0">Shadows of the evening</p>
<p class="t">Steal across the sky;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus, grant the weary</p>
<p class="t">Calm and sweet repose;</p>
<p class="t0">With Thy tenderest blessing</p>
<p class="t">May our eyelids close.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">. . . <span class="hst">. . .</span> <span class="hst">. . .</span></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Through the long night watches</p>
<p class="t">May Thine angels spread</p>
<p class="t0">Their white wings above me,</p>
<p class="t">Watching round my bed.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The next Sunday morning the minister was back
in his pulpit, and with a spirit of gratitude announced
the hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty!</p>
<p class="t">Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;</p>
<p class="t0">Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty,</p>
<p class="t">God in Three Persons, blessed Trinity.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p class="tb">How there was a change for the better during a
sickness is revealed in this account:</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Why, That&rsquo;s For Me</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>A minister&rsquo;s wife with whom I am well acquainted
has told of the time when her only sister
lay on a bed of pain in a hospital in one of the suburbs
of Chicago. Her father and mother, being sent
for, reached the bedside at nightfall. A brief interview
was permitted. The father, bending low above
his girl, heard her faintly say, &ldquo;Oh, Dad, I&rsquo;ve lost
my grip.&rdquo; Great anxiety, therefore, was on his
mind as he left the room.</p>
<p>Fearing the answer he might receive, yet hungering
for news, the father telephoned as early the
next morning as he dared. &ldquo;How is the girl today?&rdquo;
was his agonized question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holding her own. In fact, she has made slight
progress through the night,&rdquo; was the glad and astonishing
answer. Father and mother, therefore,
soon hastened to the hospital. There they learned
that the daughter&rsquo;s recovery was now a possibility.</p>
<p>Later the parents learned the cause of the happy
change. A window had been opened by a nurse, and
there came through it to the accompaniment of a
piano a clear baritone voice singing: &ldquo;What a
Friend we have in Jesus!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s for me,&rdquo; whispered the sufferer,
as she heard the words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Are we weak and heavy laden,</p>
<p class="t">Cumbered with a load of care?</p>
<p class="t0">Precious Saviour, still our refuge,</p>
<p class="t">Take it to the Lord in prayer.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Restful assurance was expressed in the closing
lines:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;In His arms He&rsquo;ll take and shield thee,</p>
<p class="t">Thou wilt find a solace there.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Making the words her prayer, by asking Christ
to take and shield her, she turned her face to the
wall and the first natural sleep for weeks followed.
From that hour her recovery began.</p>
<p class="tb">Harriet Beecher Stowe awoke one morning to
find herself famous as the author of <i>Uncle Tom&rsquo;s
Cabin</i>. The excellent reception given this book was
gratifying, but more than anything else was</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Satisfying Consciousness of God&rsquo;s Presence</span></h3>
<p>She wrote her husband at this time, from the
home of her brother, Henry Ward Beecher, that
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
she felt a wonderful consciousness of God&rsquo;s presence,
which above all else quieted and comforted
and satisfied her soul. Then she wrote out this experience
in the beautiful hymn, &ldquo;Still, still with
Thee,&rdquo; which first appeared in the Plymouth
Hymnal. Set to Mendelssohn&rsquo;s music, it is one of
the richest recent additions to hymnology. This
hymn-prayer was the response of her soul and
voiced a deep experience of the peace that passeth
all understanding. It tells most impressively what
are some of the benefits of prayer:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Still, still with Thee, when purple morning breaketh,</p>
<p class="t">When the bird waketh, and the shadows flee;</p>
<p class="t0">Fairer than morning, lovelier than daylight,</p>
<p class="t">Dawns the sweet consciousness, I am with Thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">. . . <span class="hst">. . .</span> <span class="hst">. . .</span></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Still, still with Thee! As to each newborn morning</p>
<p class="t">A fresh and solemn splendor still is given,</p>
<p class="t0">So does this blessed consciousness, awaking,</p>
<p class="t">Breathe each day nearness unto Thee and heaven.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p class="tb">What the divine presence means is strikingly
seen where a man in danger was able to pray and
to realize that he was</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Not Alone</span></h3>
<p>Seven men were buried beneath thousands of
tons of rocks which fell without a moment&rsquo;s warning
in a Cornish tin mine early in the twentieth
century. Willing hands immediately began the work
of rescue, though all despaired of finding anyone
alive. Their worst fears, however, were not realized.
One man was found a little distance from his
comrades, and was uninjured. The rocks had
formed an arch over him.</p>
<p>Encouraged by finding this one miner, those who
were engaged in the work of rescue called loudly
to ascertain if any others were alive and able to
speak. One man answered. He was an active Christian,
and Sunday School superintendent. &ldquo;Are you
alone?&rdquo; he was asked. The questioner, of course,
was thinking of his fellow laborers. &ldquo;No; Christ is
with me,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Are you injured?&rdquo; was
the next question. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the imprisoned
man, &ldquo;my legs are held fast by something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those engaged in the conversation were then
greatly surprised as they heard this man, who often
sang when descending to and ascending from his
daily task, now begin to sing in a feeble voice:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Abide with me! Fast falls the eventide;</p>
<p class="t0">The darkness deepens&mdash;Lord, with me abide!</p>
<p class="t0">When other helpers fail and comforts flee,</p>
<p class="t0">Help of the helpless, O abide with me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>They heard no more from him. Two days later
he was found with his legs crushed by a huge rock
which rested on them. Both his life and his last
words of song, however, gave the assurance that he
had gone to be &ldquo;forever with the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Songs of the Negroes</i></span></h2>
<p>Whatever else may be said about <i>The Green Pastures</i>
by Marc Connelly, it obviously represents the
naive and simple faith of thousands of untutored
black Christians in the South. They accept the wonders
of the Old Testament with crude literalness
and they unhesitatingly believe that these marvels
can be reproduced in their own lives.</p>
<p>One of the chief values of this play is the discerning
use made of the unique spirituals which are
a distinctive contribution of America to music. No
one who has ever heard them sung can forget the
impression of pathos at times rising to the heights
of astonishing power. Without any regard for
rhyme, rhythm or meter, these dialect songs express
the long suppressed longings for freedom and
happiness. The Negro furthermore firmly believes
that these benefits are to be realized by means of
religion alone. However sensuous may be some of
the figures of speech, the emphasis is always on the
supremacy of spiritual values.</p>
<p>There are other features in Negro singing especially
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
connected with religious revivals which throw
light on the characteristic traits of this people. Aggrey
of Africa was a remarkable representative of
the Negro race. His life, written by Edwin W.
Smith, is one of the outstanding biographies of recent
times. He once said, &ldquo;I believe that the Negro
has a great gift for the world; the gift of the idea
of meeting injustice and ostracism and oppression
by sunny light-hearted love and work. I believe he
is going to teach that to Asia and the white folk.&rdquo;
His attitude to life is best expressed in songs as
indicated by a few illustrations in this chapter.</p>
<p class="tb">Dr. Willis J. King, president of Samuel Houston
College, Austin, Texas, in a recent article in
<i>The Christian Advocate</i>, pointed out</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Value of Negro Spirituals</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;The peculiarity of both the melody and the
dialect of the spirituals tends to make them difficult
for people other than American Negroes to
render. But these difficulties are being overcome.
With increasing frequency they are being rendered
by white American choirs and congregations. Some
of them, like &lsquo;Lord, I Want to be a Christian&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Were You There When They Crucified My
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
Lord?&rsquo; are quite singable, after brief rehearsals, by
the ordinary church group of any race or nationality.
So it would seem not too much to expect that
a number of these spirituals will ultimately find
their place among the great hymns of the Church,
and be sung down through the ages by Christians
of every land.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The ability to sing the spirituals depends upon</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Finding the Soul of the Song</span></h3>
<p>Dr. Bruce S. Wright tells of a well-known
American-Italian tenor who said that he never sang
a selection until he found out the soul of the number.
For that reason he refrained from singing Negro
spirituals until he had spent considerable time
in the South living among the Negroes, listening
to them sing. So today he sings &ldquo;Steal Away&rdquo; as he
heard it sung at a Negro revival; and he sings &ldquo;Goin&rsquo;
Home&rdquo; as he heard it sung at the dying bed of
an aged Negro in a Negro&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p class="tb">Here is a vivid description by Annemarie Ewing
in <i>The Christian Herald</i>:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<h3><span class="sc">How the Negroes Sing</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;In the huge stadium, dropped like a bowl beneath
the starlit sky, thousands of people sit waiting
to hear the Hall Johnson Choir. Overhead the
sky is indigo, dotted with twinkling stars, glorious
with the cool silver of a full moon. A tender, capricious
wind breathes softly over the semicircle of
the waiting crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now they come&mdash;a handful of Negroes, perhaps
a dozen men and a half dozen women. So
small a group looks lost on the big platform. At a
signal from their leader they begin.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Wade in de water, chillun,</p>
<p class="t0">God&rsquo;s a&rsquo;goin&rsquo; to trouble de water...&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Challenging as the voice of a delivered soul,
the strong, clear bass gives out the words; others
join in&mdash;a soprano acquiescence, a contralto surge
of content, the ecstatic agreement of the tenor. Joy
throbs through the singers&rsquo; throats, their cup of joy
runneth over!</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;See dat band all dressed in white,</p>
<p class="t0">De leader looks like the Israelite...&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;How the leader draws them out&mdash;to send their
message surging across the summer night into the
hearts of thousands!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Wade in de water,</p>
<p class="t0">God&rsquo;s a-goin&rsquo; to trouble de water...&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The last note swells and is still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a moment they begin again. This time it is a
joyous refrain, pulsing with the firmness of blessed
assurance&mdash;assurance that warms the heart and
moistens the eyes.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;My God is so high you can&rsquo;t get above Him,</p>
<p class="t0">My God is so low you can&rsquo;t get below Him,</p>
<p class="t0">My God is so wide you can&rsquo;t get around Him,</p>
<p class="t0">You must come in through de door...&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your soul thrills to the swinging certainty.
Yes, He is so high, you can&rsquo;t get above Him, so
low you can&rsquo;t get below Him; so wide you can&rsquo;t
get around Him! There is no way in but through
the Gate!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The music dies away, far above the stars gleam&mdash;detached,
assured, eternal. From your eyes, quite
unashamed, you brush away the tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus do they worship our Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">It was a memorable day in one man&rsquo;s life when</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Black Uncle&rsquo;s Song Made a Minister</span></h3>
<p>A well-known white minister in the Middle
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
West owed his conversion and his entrance into the
ministry to an unexpected circumstance. He belonged
to a company that was playing in Louisville.
After the performance he left the theater at
a late hour to take a turn around the streets of the
city. He passed through a little park and saw a
bent old Negro &ldquo;uncle&rdquo; sitting on a bench. As he
approached the actor heard him singing softly to
himself. And the song was &ldquo;Jesus, Lovah uv Mah
Soul.&rdquo; The tenderness and feeling of the darky&rsquo;s
song and the clear tone of his aged voice held the
listener spellbound.</p>
<p>When the last verse was sung the youthful actor
went up to the singer and pulling out a big bill
said: &ldquo;Uncle, you&rsquo;re an old man, and it&rsquo;s late for
you to be out like this. If you have no home, this
will help you a bit. Take it and go and be comfortable
for a few days, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Negro took off his hat and said, &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s
pow&rsquo;ful kind uv you, boss. Ah&rsquo;s ol&rsquo;, an&rsquo; Ah ain&rsquo;t got
no home, an&rsquo; ef hit&rsquo;s jes&rsquo; de same to you Ah&rsquo;ll take
jes&rsquo; a bit uv dat money&mdash;&rsquo;case somehow or udder
de good Lawd he sen&rsquo;s me a bit ev&rsquo;y day. But Ah
don&rsquo;t need any mo&rsquo;, &rsquo;case he allus loks arter me,
ev&rsquo;y day. An&rsquo; hit don&rsquo;t matter, boss, ef an ol&rsquo; man&rsquo;s
ol&rsquo;, an&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t got no home, jes&rsquo; so&rsquo;s he kin sing dat
&rsquo;ere song uv mine. Ah&rsquo;d like to sing hit again to
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
yo&rsquo;, jes&rsquo; case you done gib me dis. Hit&rsquo;s a wunnerful
song, boss. Hit&rsquo;s called, &lsquo;Jesus, Lovah uv Mah
Soul!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then sang it again softly. The actor heard
him through and then shaking hands with the Negro,
to his surprise, said, &ldquo;Good night, uncle.
You&rsquo;ve done a good night&rsquo;s work with that song&mdash;better
than ever I&rsquo;ve done with my life. Because
you&rsquo;ve started me doing something&mdash;for I&rsquo;m going
to learn to sing that song, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the beginning of an experience which
resulted in a gifted man becoming a minister of
Christ.</p>
<p class="tb">The characteristic gratitude of the dark race was
illustrated when</p>
<h3><span class="sc">A Negro Family Sang at John Brown&rsquo;s Funeral</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;John Brown&rsquo;s Body Rests Amid the Mountains,&rdquo;
wrote Mary Lee in <i>The New York Times</i>,
October, 1929, as she vividly told the story of the
life of this dramatic figure in a fascinating manner.
At that time, she affirmed, there was still living at
North Elba one man who could remember John
Brown. His name was Lyman Epps, &ldquo;the son of
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
one of those Negroes whom John Brown came to
North Elba to help.&rdquo; This writer adds: &ldquo;The Epps
family it was who sang as a quartet at John Brown&rsquo;s
funeral in 1859. Lyman Epps remembers it to this
day&mdash;how he stood at the foot of the open casket
singing bass, his father at the head, singing tenor,
and his two sisters, Amelia and Evelyn, singing soprano
and alto, at his side.&rdquo; The hymn they sang
was John Brown&rsquo;s favorite:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Blow ye the trumpet, blow!</p>
<p class="t">The gladly solemn sound</p>
<p class="t0">Let all the nations know,</p>
<p class="t">To earth&rsquo;s remotest bound,</p>
<p class="t0">The year of jubilee is come!</p>
<p class="t">Return, ye ransomed sinners, home.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Christmas and Easter Melodies</i></span></h2>
<p>These two great festivals of the Christian year fittingly
celebrate the Incarnation and Resurrection
of Christ. Just as hope came with the Saviour of
the world, so hope was quickened when He won
the signal victory over death. He is indeed the unspeakable
gift of God, and the spirit of gratitude
for this marvelous blessing is best celebrated in song.</p>
<p>The greatest hymns of the Church are inspired
by these two events, which have liberated the human
spirit and filled it with faith, joy, enthusiasm,
loyalty. All the greatest poets, artists, musicians,
were illuminated by the Christmas and Easter messages,
and excelled themselves in setting forth the
jubilant truths of redemption and eternal life
through Christ the Lord of love and light. These
productions have enriched the thought, excited the
imagination and ennobled the lives of multitudes
through all the Christian centuries. This they will
continue to do to the end of time.</p>
<p>The fount of poetic and artistic inspiration still
flows, and from time to time there are added new
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
contributions to swell the jubilation of these two
seasons and to spread peace and goodwill among
men.</p>
<p class="tb">Bishop F. W. Warne recalls</p>
<h3><span class="sc">An Incarnation Hymn that Fires the Imagination</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;The Church of the Lord Jesus Christ for two
thousand years, on the anniversary of the sinless Incarnation,
has sung hymns of joy and praise. Here
is a part of the hymn that, when a child, fired my
heart and imagination, when I heard it sung on
such anniversaries, and it fires them still:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Mortals, awake, with angels join,</p>
<p class="t">And chant the solemn lay;</p>
<p class="t0">Joy, love, and gratitude combine,</p>
<p class="t">To hail the auspicious day.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">

<p class="t">Hail, Brother, Friend!</p>
<p class="t0">Though earth, and time, and life shall fail,</p>
<p class="t">The praise shall never end.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">Carols have invariably been sung on Christmas
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
Eve, and the following incident from the Syracuse
<i>Post Standard</i> illustrates</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Joy of Christmas</span></h3>
<p>All members of the family were gathered in the
cozy living room of a south side home. The lights
were out, but the mellow glow from a cheery fireplace
illuminated the room with the soft light
which seems to symbolize peace and quiet. Children
romped on the floor; a playful puppy bounded
here and there, yipping joyously; the old cat
blinked sleepily and purred with contentment.
Father was reading the paper and mother was perusing
a magazine.</p>
<p>In the windows hung red bells, and through the
window the snow lay white and sparkling under
the street lamps. A playful wind whipped up little
swirling flurries of snow at intervals. Suddenly it
came, clear through the night. Soft music, then a
burst of song&mdash;&ldquo;It Came Upon the Midnight
Clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All within listened to the music in the night&mdash;Christmas
music, carols. Then as it came nearer all
rushed to the windows and saw a band of boys and
men marching bravely by, blowing trumpets, horns&mdash;what
not? The spirit of Christmas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p class="tb">Carols are also a part of the celebration on Christmas
Day, and how they cheered the patients in a
hospital is described when</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Nurses Sang Carols</span></h3>
<p>The nurses enjoyed a breakfast served by candle
light at 6:30 on Christmas morning at the Faxton
Hospital in Utica, New York, and then exchanged
greetings. After this, clad in their uniforms, including
their blue capes, attractively red-lined, they
formed in a procession and marched from floor to
floor of the building singing the familiar Christmas
songs. Young mothers and their little babies, in the
maternity building, were not forgotten. The nurses
marched from the main building in the cold morning
and sang as they walked along the sidewalk
until they reached the maternity department, where
they continued their carols.</p>
<p>This self-appointed task conveyed pleasure beyond
the power of words to express to the patients,
some of whom were far away from loved ones.
The act was one of those beautiful touches which
unites the whole Christian world in a kindred feeling
on Christmas Day.</p>
<p class="tb">The thoughtful hospitality of the Maier family
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
in the village of Oberndorf, Germany, led one of
the guests, the young priest Joseph Mohr, to write
the well-known Christmas song,</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Silent Night</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>At this party a festival play was performed in
view of the approaching Christmas. It so stirred
the young priest that instead of returning home he
climbed the Totenberg, Mountain of the Dead,
overlooking the village. He stood there in quiet
meditation. The silence of the night, the blinking
of the stars, the murmur of the Salzach River, all
inspired him. Quickly he returned to his parish
house and late that night the words of &ldquo;Stille
Nacht&rdquo; were written. The next day he hastened to
his organist, Franz Gruber, and requested that he
write the music for this song. He composed the
well-known tune. On Christmas Eve of 1818 the
priest and organist were ready to offer their contribution
for the first time. The organ proved to be
out of commission but Gruber was ingenious. He
hurried home and brought his guitar and to its accompaniment
he and the priest sang &ldquo;Stille Nacht&rdquo;
as a duet. It touched the congregation deeply and
after the service the two friends, with tears of joy
in their eyes, embraced on the steps of the church in
gratitude for this impressive rendition. Since that
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
evening the song has become one of the Christmas
favorites all over the world.</p>
<p class="tb">Bishop Phillips Brooks was the friend of children
as well as adults. His popularity as rector of
the Church of the Advent in Philadelphia was unbounded
and it continued when he went to Trinity
Church, Boston. It was during a year&rsquo;s vacation
that he had an experience which later resulted in
his writing the well-known hymn,</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">O Little Town of Bethlehem</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>In the course of his travels during this vacation
he went to the Holy Land. On Christmas Eve he
was in Bethlehem. He walked in the fields where
the shepherds had heard the angelic chorus. He
listened to the hymns of praise that kept ringing
out upon the clear air. He saw the children of
Bethlehem getting ready for Christmas. Two years
later when he was back home his mind went back
to his experiences in Bethlehem. He recalled the
dark streets, the clear blue sky with stars, the quiet
shepherds&rsquo; fields; and under the spell of these
memories, in 1868, he wrote this Christmas hymn
especially for the children of his Sunday School.
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
His organist, Lewis H. Render, wrote the music
for this much beloved song.</p>
<p class="tb">This graphic description by Annemarie Ewing in
<i>The Christian Herald</i> tells of</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Carols Sung by Children</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of any holier sound for Christmas
Eve than that of young voices, clear and sweet in
the cold, singing the simple, tuneful melodies that
can&rsquo;t grow old. Last year it was my pleasure and
privilege to know a small group of youngsters who
wanted to go caroling Christmas Eve. They didn&rsquo;t
mind the cold or the long walk or the wind and
snow. They wanted to sing!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see those bobbing little heads now, all
sizes and shapes&mdash;from Rose Marie&rsquo;s tall, smartly
hatted elegance to Babe&rsquo;s roly-poly woolen cap,
just under my arm. How eager they were, and
what stories I had to tell them to keep them quiet
till we got to each place! We planned to sing under
the windows of all our special friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how we did sing! I do not know whether
it was sweeter to stand there holding my hand before
Babe&rsquo;s candle while her big blue eyes were
lifted up to see the book (she had to stand on her
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
very tip-toes!), or whether it would have been
more exquisite pleasure to have been sitting in my
warm living-room, when the shrilly sweet voices of
the children began with their own enthusiasm:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Joy to the world! the Lord is come;</p>
<p class="t0">Let earth receive her King!</p>
<p class="t0">Let every heart prepare Him room,</p>
<p class="t0">And Heav&rsquo;n and Nature sing.</p>
<p class="t0">And Heav&rsquo;n and Nature sing,</p>
<p class="t0">And Heav&rsquo;n and Heav&rsquo;n and Nature sing.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know that there were tears in my own eyes
when we reached &lsquo;Silent Night,&rsquo; and that from the
tight closed window of old Mr. Simmons, crotchety
and bad-tempered, there fell a shower of walnuts
and pecans! In the big house across the way
where a little child lay ill the windows were softly
raised, and I could not help but stoop and kiss
chubby Babe, who pulled my arm to whisper that
&lsquo;she hoped Margaret-who-was-sick heard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas Carols! Whether they are sung
aloud or whether they buzz and chime through
your heart&mdash;it is the same. Let them ring out!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">One of the well-known celebrations is that on</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<h3><span class="sc">Easter Morning in America&rsquo;s Bethlehem</span></h3>
<p>The Moravians celebrate Easter with impressive
ceremonies in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Early in
the morning the trombonists walk through the
quiet streets of the city and awaken the people with
their inspiring anthem. Soon lights appear in the
windows of the homes and the people join the procession
towards the old church, greeting each other
with gladsome salutations. The Easter service in
the church continues till sunrise when the congregation
march out, led by the trombonists, to the
ancient burying-ground.</p>
<p>At this place of sacred memories the people
stand in a large semicircle looking towards the
eastern hill, as a symbol of their devout faith. The
ministers and trombone choir stand apart, and the
service proceeds with song and responsive readings.
The atmosphere of reverence and hope pervades
this company on the chilly morning of early spring,
as they confess their faith in the glorious resurrection
and celebrate the triumph of their loved ones
in Christ. The appearance of the sun over the hill
is the signal for the outburst of a hymn of adoration
and praise, to the accompaniment of the trombones.
This Easter service, begun in the church and
concluded in the cemetery, is a memorable occasion,
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
attended by thousands from all parts of the country,
as has been done for many years. It is a testimony
to a virile and victorious Christianity which
sings, &ldquo;Christ the Lord is risen today, Hallelujah!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Here is a fine Easter anthology from a sermon
by Dr. George Elliott in <i>The Methodist Review</i>,
which reminds us of what</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Hymn Writers Tell of Heaven</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to Cardinal Newman, the Roman Catholic,
as in the delicately beautiful poem, &lsquo;Lead,
Kindly Light,&rsquo; he dreams and speaks about the time
when:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;The night is gone</p>
<p class="t0">And in the morn those angel faces smile</p>
<p class="t0">Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then Isaac Watts, the Nonconformist, has
no gloomy view when he says:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Give me the wings of faith to rise</p>
<p class="t">Within the veil and see</p>
<p class="t0">The saints above, how great their joys,</p>
<p class="t">How bright their glories be.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;And John Fawcett, the Baptist, who has written
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
the very finest hymn of Christian fellowship,
&lsquo;Blest Be the Tie That Binds,&rsquo; sings for us:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;When we asunder part,</p>
<p class="t">It gives us inward pain;</p>
<p class="t0">But we shall still be joined in heart,</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">From sorrow, toil and pain,</p>
<p class="t">And sin we shall be free;</p>
<p class="t0">And perfect love and friendship reign</p>
<p class="t">Through all eternity.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;And Muhlenberg, the Episcopalian, joins in
the chorus that the poet-choir are singing, and lifts
his gaze to that heavenly country, and exultantly
sings:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Where the saints of all ages in harmony meet,</p>
<p class="t0">Their Saviour and brethren transported to greet;</p>
<p class="t0">While the anthems of rapture unceasingly roll,</p>
<p class="t0">And the smile of the Lord is the feast of the soul.&rsquo;</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Salvation Army Music on Easter Morning</span></h3>
<p>Brooklyn&rsquo;s Easter Dawn Service in 1930 found
ten thousand people assembled at Prospect Park
Plaza for a community gathering under the auspices
of the Brooklyn Federation of Churches. The
first in the order of worship was a selection by the
Salvation Army Band.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Low in the grave He lay&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus, my Saviour!</p>
<p class="t0">Waiting the coming day&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus, my Lord!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Up from the grave He arose,</p>
<p class="t0">With a mighty triumph o&rsquo;er His foes;</p>
<p class="t0">He arose a victor from the dark domain,</p>
<p class="t0">And He lives forever with His saints to reign:</p>
<p class="t0">He arose! He arose!</p>
<p class="t0">Hallelujah! Christ arose!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It was so appealingly appropriate that every
listener seemed to be touched, and men quietly
lifted their hats even though the morning was cool.</p>
<p>The band led the various hymns, the closing one
of which was&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;All hail the power of Jesus&rsquo; name!</p>
<p class="t">Let angels prostrate fall;</p>
<p class="t0">Bring forth the royal diadem,</p>
<p class="t">And crown Him Lord of all.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>What proved to be the climax of this exhilarating
service was reached when the Salvation Army band
left the scene playing their favorite marching song
of conquest, &ldquo;Onward, Christian Soldiers!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">How the good we do comes back to us is seen in
a familiar hymn,</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Sung by and for Sankey</span></h3>
<p>When lying in weakness and the darkness of
blindness the musical genius of the evangelistic
world, Ira D. Sankey, was visited by Dr. F. B.
Meyer, of London, a long-time friend. &ldquo;Would
you like me to sing something for you?&rdquo; asked
Sankey as Meyer was about to leave. Then he began:
&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no dark valley when Jesus comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though weak, he continued through all four
stanzas, ending with</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be songs of greeting when Jesus comes,</p>
<p class="t0">There&rsquo;ll be songs of greeting when Jesus comes;</p>
<p class="t0">And a joyful meeting when Jesus comes</p>
<p class="t0">To gather His loved ones home.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>On an Easter morning a group of young people
went to the home of Sankey in Brooklyn, when he
was in his last illness, and outside the window amid
the morning sunshine sang the hymn which he had
sung to thousands of others, and which he greatly
cherished: &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll Be No Dark Valley When
Jesus Comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thoughtfulness of these young people was
greatly appreciated by the great evangelistic singer.
It was an inspiringly appropriate message for a sunrise
song service on an Easter morning.<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a></p>

<p>The Christian assurance of immortality brings its
message of consolation most appropriately in life&rsquo;s
darkest hours when death invades the family circle.
No one has pierced the veil between the present and
the future life, but there is a sense of the fitness of
things which has convinced men of divers creeds
that a life beyond is a reality. It is the desire for
completion and not merely for continuance which
quickens in our breast the hope of life everlasting.
It is moreover certified to us by the fact of the living
Christ through whom we commune with God. This
experience convinces us that our earthly pilgrimage
is the prelude to the heavenly life of spiritual attainment
and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Thus when the physical remains of our loved
ones are consigned to the earth, we have the assured
confidence of a reunion in the land that is fairer
than day. Since Jesus Christ has brought life and
immortality to light through the Gospel, we know
that death does not sever the ties which bind us to
those who have crossed the flood. We shall meet
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
again when the day dawns and these shadows flee
away. This is the outlook of faith which comforts
and cheers us.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;For what e&rsquo;er befalls, Love conquers all,</p>
<p class="t0">And Death shall not prevail.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">The thought deepest in the soul often finds expression
at a crisis. This fact is what led to the</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Hymn of Martyred President Sung by the Nation</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, good-bye, all,&rdquo; said President William
McKinley as he lay dying in Buffalo, a few
days after he was shot on September 6, 1901. &ldquo;It is
God&rsquo;s way. His will, not ours, be done,&rdquo; he added
soon afterwards. Toward the end in the presence of
his wife and intimate friends, his lips moved again
and with a light on his worn face, his inner soul
expressed itself in the lines of his favorite hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Nearer, my God, to Thee,</p>
<p class="t">Nearer to Thee!</p>
<p class="t0">E&rsquo;en though it be a cross&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>A moment of silence followed and then in a whisper
he said, &ldquo;That has been my inextinguishable
prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>The funeral services at the Capitol began with
&ldquo;Lead, Kindly Light,&rdquo; sung by the choir, and concluded
with &ldquo;Nearer, My God, to Thee.&rdquo; The final
service was held in the First Methodist Episcopal
Church, Canton, Ohio, of which he was a member.</p>
<p>During those days of sadness the nation sang
this familiar hymn which profoundly moved the
popular heart. Possibly in all the history of the
United States, the nation has never so unitedly
joined in singing a particular hymn as during those
days. It was a national tribute to a fallen leader.</p>
<p>In the City of Utica, New York, the home of
Vice-President James S. Sherman, as soon as word
was received of his death, October 30, 1912, the
leader of the orchestra in the chief hotel asked
the company in the dining room to stand, while
&ldquo;Nearer, My God, to Thee&rdquo; was played. Thus the
song which was sung for a fallen President was
likewise rendered in his home town when a Vice-President
passed thence.</p>
<p class="tb">It is a hallowed custom to sing a person&rsquo;s favorite
hymn at his funeral. Thus it was that there was
sung at his funeral,</p>
<h3><span class="sc">President Wilson&rsquo;s Favorite Hymn</span></h3>
<p>Visitors at the Chautauqua Assembly, especially in
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
the days of its founder, Bishop J. H. Vincent, can
never forget the Sunday evening vesper services.
One hymn in particular was always sung: &ldquo;Day is
Dying in the West,&rdquo; written by Mary A. Lathbury,
at Bishop Vincent&rsquo;s request.</p>
<p>This happened to be President Wilson&rsquo;s favorite
hymn. His remains were carried to Bethlehem
Chapel on the cathedral grounds in Washington,
D. C. Over the outer door of this chapel the inscription
in the stone work is &ldquo;The Way of Peace.&rdquo;
During the service the men&rsquo;s voices of the choir led
by a clear tenor gave the favorite hymn an infinitely
sweet appeal, especially the lines:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Gather us who seek Thy face</p>
<p class="t0">To the fold of Thy embrace,</p>
<p class="t2">For Thou art nigh.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">It has been well said that some tunes and hymns
are so closely united that one recalls the other.
Thus it was that</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Bells Played Hymns When Taft Was Buried</span></h3>
<p>The service was held in the quaint little Unitarian
Church in Washington, D. C. Floral wreaths
and sprays abounded, representing the deep affection
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
and high respect for a former President of the
United States and later the Chief Justice. The dirge
notes of Chopin&rsquo;s Funeral March, a flourish of
trumpets saluting a President, and the tolling of
the great bell of All Souls&rsquo; Church, as has been the
practice since 1822 at the passing of Presidents, constituted
parts of this impressive service. No hymns
were sung but there was the soft music of the bells
which pealed forth the strains of &ldquo;Abide With Me.&rdquo;
The words were not spoken but the familiar verses
ran through the minds of the congregation:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Abide with me! Fast falls the eventide,</p>
<p class="t0">The darkness deepens&mdash;Lord, with me abide!</p>
<p class="t0">When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,</p>
<p class="t0">Help of the helpless, O, abide with me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">Few hymns have had so many remarkable associations
as, &ldquo;Peace, Perfect Peace,&rdquo; written by Bishop
Edward H. Bickersteth. It has brought comfort to
many and on one occasion, as stated below, the
author himself was</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Comforted by His Own Hymn</span></h3>
<p>An informed contributor to <i>The Churchman</i>
writes as follows of this hymn&rsquo;s vogue: &ldquo;It has
been sung at the obsequies of princes and statesmen
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
as well as at the funerals of the poor. It has afforded
consolation to the mourner in the palace as well as
to the grief-stricken peasant in the cottage. It was
a favorite hymn with the good old Queen of England,
and it was sung in her death chamber at Osborne.
It has sustained the lonely soul of Bishop
Hannington when he was a caged prisoner in Central
Africa awaiting execution from the hand of a
heathen king. They were the sweet stanzas that
bound up the broken heart of General Roberts when
his only son was placed in a soldier&rsquo;s grave in South
Africa. It has been sung at the interment of authors,
actors and statesmen in Westminster Abbey and St.
Paul&rsquo;s. When in the cemetery of the village of
Chislebon, Wiltshire, England, the early harvest
was being gathered and shepherds were folding
their flocks, the venerable prelate stood at the head
of his eldest son&rsquo;s open grave as this hymn, so often
quoted in the hour of death and sung on the day of
burial, struck a note of Christian hope to the bereaved
spirit of its author. On this side of the
Atlantic the hymn is sung at almost every funeral
service conducted in church, and Mr. Coldbeck&rsquo;s
appropriate tune, &lsquo;Pax Tecum,&rsquo; is singularly adapted
to its soothing and inspiring strains.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;A good hymn is the most difficult thing to
write,&rdquo; said Alfred, Lord Tennyson. It was not
until his eighty-first year that he succeeded in writing
his single great hymn, &ldquo;Crossing the Bar,&rdquo;
although stanzas from his <i>In Memoriam</i> are sung
as hymns. It was, therefore, most fitting that its first
public use was as an anthem at the poet&rsquo;s funeral in
Westminster Abbey on October 12, 1892. The description
of the scene, written by the daughter of
the Dean of Westminster, is here quoted in part of
the singing of</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Tennyson&rsquo;s Hymn at His Funeral</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;In the intense and solemn silence which followed
the reading of the lesson were heard the
voices of the choir singing in subdued and tender
tones Tennyson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Crossing the Bar&rsquo;&mdash;those beautiful
words in which the poet, as it were, prophetically
foretold his calm and peaceful deathbed. In the
second line the clear, thrilling notes of a boy&rsquo;s voice
sounded like a silver trumpet call amongst the
arches, and it was only at intervals that one distinguished
Dr. Bridge&rsquo;s beautiful organ accompaniment,
which swelled gradually from a subdued
murmur as of the morning tide into a triumphant
burst from the voices, so blended together were
words and music.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>One of the best hymns of fervent devotion is</p>

<p class="tb">Illness and suffering had been the lot of its
author. She worked under difficulties and might
well have said with the Apostle Paul, &ldquo;Most gladly
therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that
the power of Christ may rest upon me.&rdquo; Her characteristic
confidence was, however, expressed in the</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Text Selected by Miss Havergal for Her Tombstone</span></h3>
<p>Her last days found her at Caswell Bay, Swansea,
Wales, where she had gone for a rest. When
informed that she was approaching the end of her
sufferings, she is said to have answered, &ldquo;If I am
going, it is too good to be true.&rdquo; Death came on
June 3, 1879, in the forty-third year of her age;
and she was laid to rest in the Astley churchyard
beside her father, and close to the church and home
of her childhood. By her own desire her favorite
text was carved on her tombstone: &ldquo;The Blood of
Jesus Christ His Son Cleanseth Us From All Sin.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb">It was an unusual scene, according to <i>The Standard</i>,
that comforted the bereaved mother as well

<h3><span class="sc">When Parepa Sang at Annie&rsquo;s Funeral</span></h3>
<p>This famous singer, through a friend, attended
the funeral of Annie, the only daughter of a poor
widowed mother, in the East End of London. This
friend&rsquo;s description is worth quoting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The undertaker came and bustled about. He
looked at myself and Parepa, as if to say, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s time
to go. The wretched funeral service is over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without a word, Parepa rose and walked to the
head of the coffin. She laid her white scarf on an
empty chair, threw her cloak back from her shoulders,
where it fell in long, soft, black lines from
her noble figure like the drapery of mourning. She
laid her soft, fair hand on the cold forehead, passed
it tenderly over the wasted, delicate face, looked
down at the dead girl a moment, and moved my
flowers from the stained box to the thin fingers,
then lifted up her head, and, with illumined eyes,
sang the glorious melody:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Angels ever bright and fair,</p>
<p class="t0">Take, oh, take me to thy care.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Her magnificent voice rose and fell in all its
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
richness and power and pity and beauty. She looked
above the dingy room and the tired faces of the
men and women, the hard hands and the struggling
hearts. She threw back her head and sang till
the choirs of paradise must have paused to listen to
the music of that day. She passed her hand caressingly
over the girl&rsquo;s soft, dark hair, sang on and on;
&lsquo;Take, oh, <i>take her</i> to Thy care.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mother&rsquo;s face grew rapt and white. I held
her hands and watched her eyes. Suddenly she
threw my hands off and knelt at Parepa&rsquo;s feet, close
to the wooden trestles. She locked her fingers together,
tears and sobs breaking forth. She prayed
aloud that God would bless the angel singing for
Annie. A patient smile settled about her lips, and
the light came back into her poor, dulled eyes, and
she kissed her daughter&rsquo;s face with a love beyond
all interpretation of human speech. I led her back
to her seat as the last glorious notes of Parepa&rsquo;s
voice rose triumphant over all earthly pain and
sorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I thought that no queen ever went to her
grave with a greater ceremony than this young
daughter of poverty and toil, committed to the care
of angels.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p class="tb">An unusual funeral service was held when, instead
of the family sitting in silence,</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Each Member of the Family Sang a Verse</span></h3>
<p>The description must be quoted in full as it
appeared in <i>The Christian Advocate</i>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was in Rome a friend came to me asking
if I would be a pallbearer at the funeral of a
young American girl. Her family wished only
Americans present at the little service. I went to the
room where the casket stood and presently the family
entered&mdash;a noble lady, evidently the mother,
a daughter and two sons, the eldest leading a little
girl. They surrounded the casket and softly repeated
the Apostles&rsquo; Creed. Then the mother&rsquo;s
voice, uncertain and trembling, began:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Shall we gather at the river</p>
<p class="t">Where bright angel feet have trod,</p>
<p class="t0">With its crystal tide forever</p>
<p class="t">Flowing by the throne of God?&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;All joined her in the chorus. Then the eldest
son, a grown man, sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;On the margin of the river,</p>
<p class="t">Washing up its silver spray,</p>
<p class="t0">We will walk and worship ever,</p>
<p class="t">All the happy golden day.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;After the chorus there was silence&mdash;a choking
silence that benumbed me. Then my friend whispered,
&lsquo;It is their family prayer service and it is her
verse.&rsquo; Then the little girl was lifted in her father&rsquo;s
arms, and sweet and clear and wonderingly came:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Ere we reach the shining river</p>
<p class="t">Lay we every burden down,</p>
<p class="t0">Grace our spirits will deliver</p>
<p class="t">And provide a robe and crown.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know how I endured it, the emotion of
that moment. In a broken manner they sobbed
through the chorus and then the younger brother,
a lad of fourteen, sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;At the smiling of the river,</p>
<p class="t">Mirror of the Saviour&rsquo;s face</p>
<p class="t0">Saints whom death will never sever</p>
<p class="t">Lift their songs of saving grace.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;His voice was so confident that it steadied all
present and the chorus rang out clearly. Then all
together they sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Soon we&rsquo;ll reach the silver river,</p>
<p class="t">Soon our pilgrimage will cease,</p>
<p class="t0">Soon our happy hearts will quiver</p>
<p class="t">With the melody of peace.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the chorus was strong, clear and almost
exultant. After repeating the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, the
minister read the service and we went to the grave.
On the way my friend told me of the many times
he had been present at this same little family service
in the Michigan home when each sang his verse
in the old hymn. &lsquo;The last verse was father&rsquo;s, and
after his death they all sang it for him, and now
the little granddaughter had picked up the broken
thread of song for her sweet young auntie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a wonderful glorification of a poor little
hymn!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Truly so,&rsquo; he agreed. &lsquo;I never before had much
respect for that piece.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The faith and loyalty of a noble Christian were
remembered when his daughter</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Played Her Father&rsquo;s Favorite Hymn at a Memorial Service</span></h3>
<p>This service conducted by the North Dakota Conference
of the Methodist Episcopal Church for
Judge Charles S. Pollock was impressively beautiful.
Held for a layman, it yet followed the ordination
of young men for the ministry. Judge Pollock,
a faithful follower of Jesus Christ and a courageous
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
advocate of civic righteousness, had dutifully carried
heavy responsibilities at the session of the
General Conference in May, 1928, and not long
thereafter was summoned into the courts of heaven.
On that autumn day at this service the judge&rsquo;s
daughter played on the organ her father&rsquo;s favorite
hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O Master, let me walk with Thee</p>
<p class="t0">In lowly paths of service free;</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Songs at a Missionary&rsquo;s Grave</span></h3>
<p>The great missionary, James Gilmour, of Mongolia,
lost his beloved wife at Peking. In a letter to
his children&rsquo;s uncle in Scotland, to whom Mr. Gilmour
had decided to entrust the two boys after
their mother&rsquo;s death, he wrote: &ldquo;Oh, it is hard to
think of them going off over the world in that
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
motherless fashion! We were at mamma&rsquo;s grave
yesterday for the first time since September 21. We
sang &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a Land That Is Fairer Than Day,&rsquo;
in Chinese, and also a Chinese hymn we have here
with a chorus, which says, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll soon go and see
them in our heavenly home,&rsquo; and in English, &lsquo;There
is a happy land.&rsquo; The children and I have no reluctance
in speaking of mamma, and we don&rsquo;t think
of her as here or buried, but as in a fine place, happy
and well.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">As the Rev. Mark Guy Pearse approached the
end of his great career as minister and author he
said to a brother minister concerning his funeral
service: &ldquo;There must be no mourning, no tears, no
misery, no gloom. I go not into the gloom but into
the dawn. Start the service with &lsquo;Praise God.&rsquo; Take
all the stops out of the organ and let everybody thunder
it out.&rdquo; Thus it was that there were sung the</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Hallelujah Chorus and Doxology at the Funeral Service</span></h3>
<p>His wishes were met, and the memorial service
at Kingsway Hall, the headquarters of the West
London Mission, was unusual. The organist played
&ldquo;I Know That My Redeemer Liveth&rdquo; as the people
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
assembled. Then came, &ldquo;Praise God, From Whom
All Blessings Flow.&rdquo; The triumphant &ldquo;Hallelujah
Chorus&rdquo; pealed forth at the close.</p>
<p>The hymns were:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Come let us join our cheerful songs</p>
<p class="t">With angels around the throne.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Nearer, my God, to Thee,</p>
<p class="t">Nearer to Thee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;For all the saints, who from their labors rest,</p>
<p class="t0">Who Thee by faith before the world confessed,</p>

</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Jerusalem the golden,</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Hymns on Patriotic Occasions</i></span></h2>
<p>The impelling motives of patriotism are best expressed
in the national anthems of the nations and
in songs which breathe the spirit of loyalty to country.
Devotion to the ideals and institutions of the
land of one&rsquo;s birth or adoption is the indispensable
qualification for the intelligent appreciation of what
other peoples hold sacred among their national possessions.
Such patriotism is neither of the hoot owl
or spread eagle type. It faces all the facts without
evasion and frankly acknowledges errors and omissions,
with the determination to improve conditions.
The patriot thus has no occasion to apologize
or defend because he shows reason for his faith in
the nation to which he has consecrated his best
powers.</p>
<p>The greatness of any nation is evidenced in the
quality of its citizenship. So judged, we have cause
for gratitude because the hymns which voice our
sentiment impressively advertise the idealism
which has inspired our activities. The same test can
be satisfactorily met by other nations. It is, therefore,
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
quite fitting that reference should be made to
their use of hymns on those special occasions when
the heart is stirred with gratitude and thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Indeed, the incidents related in this volume are
taken from the annals of different nations. The
chief interest is their testimony from experience to
what hymns have meant to them in the varied
crises of life. Such a consideration disregards racial
barriers and denominational differences. Hymns
speak the universal language of the heart, which
penetrates deeper and travels farther than the formalities
of customs peculiar to various peoples.</p>
<p>In these days of international appreciation and
co-operation it is well to remind ourselves that the
higher unity of all peoples is practicable only
through Jesus Christ. There is truly no stronger
reminder than hymns of the unity of faith, the stability
of hope, the harmony of love.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;For all are one in Thee</p>
<p class="t0">And all are Thine.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">Since it was first published on July 4, 1895, in
<i>The Congregationalist</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a> multitudes of people have
sung</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<h3><span class="sc">America, the Beautiful</span></h3>
<p>One hundred thousand persons, it has been estimated,
each day sing the patriotic poem of Miss
Katherine Lee Bates, who was a teacher of English
literature in Wellesley College. Some schools make
it a practice to have the children sing it daily. At
the commencement of Syracuse University in 1930,
a strange thrill swept the company of over one
thousand young men and women who were assembled
to receive their degrees, and the four thousand
persons who were present to witness the
graduation exercises, as they sang this hymn.
Mighty was the volume of song as the words were
reached:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;America! America!</p>
<p class="t">God shed His grace on thee,</p>
<p class="t0">And crown thy good with brotherhood</p>
<p class="t">From sea to shining sea.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The source of the inspiration of this poem was related
by Beatrice York Houghton. In an interview
Miss Bates said that she and some friends had gone
up Pike&rsquo;s Peak and the vision from that great
height exalted her soul into poetic fervor. The
wide reaches of country&mdash;her country&mdash;the dizzy
height which set her above it all, gave her a god-like
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
inspiration, and the lines which came into her
mind were remembered, afterwards to be set down.</p>
<p class="tb">The origin of a nation&rsquo;s life was strikingly evidenced
in</p>
<h3><span class="sc">A Praise Service</span></h3>
<p>St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, London, is &ldquo;the Parish
Church of the British Empire.&rdquo; When the repairs
were completed after seventeen years in 1930, a
memorable thanksgiving service was held under
the renovated dome which was Sir Christopher
Wren&rsquo;s masterpiece. This famous architect was the
son of a clergyman and such was his consuming devotion
to his work that he could have said with
Michael Angelo: &ldquo;It is enough to have bread and
to live in the faith of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Thanksgiving service was attended by one
hundred and sixty bishops of the Anglican Church,
assembled from all parts of the Empire. It was
broadcast to New York, Melbourne, Calcutta, Toronto
and other cities. Dean Inge, of St. Paul&rsquo;s,
standing on the chancel steps, exhorted everyone to
&ldquo;give praise to God that he hath called us to take
part in the joy and adventure of his glorious Kingdom.&rdquo;
The feelings of the occasion were voiced
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
by seven thousand people through Henry Lyte&rsquo;s
hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Praise, my soul, the King of Heaven!</p>
<p class="t0">To His feet thy tribute bring;</p>
<p class="t0">Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,</p>
<p class="t0">Who, like me, His Praise should sing?</p>
<p class="t0">Praise Him! praise Him! praise Him! praise Him!</p>
<p class="t0">Praise the Everlasting King!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">In <i>The War Romance of the Salvation Army</i>,
by Hill and Booth,<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a> there is a reference to what was</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Sung on Memorial Day in France</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;The girls went down to decorate the two hundred
American graves at Mandres, and even while
they bent over the flaming blossoms and laid them
on the mounds, an air battle was going on over their
heads. Close at hand was the American artillery
being moved to the front on a little narrow-gauge
railroad that ran near to the graveyard, and the
Germans were firing and trying to get them. But
the girls went steadily on with their work, scattering
flowers and setting flags until their service of
love was over. Then they stood aside for the prayer
and a song. One of the Salvation Army captains
with a fine voice began to sing:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;For loved ones in the Homeland</p>
<p class="t">Are waiting me to come</p>
<p class="t0">Where neither death nor sorrow</p>
<p class="t">Invades their holy home:</p>
<p class="t0">O dear, dear native country!</p>
<p class="t">O rest and peace above!</p>
<p class="t0">Christ, bring us all to the Homeland</p>
<p class="t">Of His eternal love.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Into the midst of the song came the engine on
the little narrow track straight toward where he
stood, and he had to step aside on to a pile of dirt to
finish his song. The same captain went on ahead to
the Homeland not long after when the epidemic of
influenza swept over the world; and he was given
the honor of a military funeral.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Edward Marshall had an article in <i>Scribner&rsquo;s
Magazine</i> in 1898 which is here abbreviated, about
the unique conditions under which the boys sang</p>
<h3><span class="sc">&ldquo;America&rdquo; After the Battle</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;There is one incident of the day which shines
out in my memory above all others now as I lie in a
New York hospital writing. It occurred at the field
hospital. About a dozen of us were lying there. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
surgeons, with hands and bared arms dripping, and
clothes literally saturated with blood, were straining
every nerve to prepare the wounded for the
journey down to Siboney. It was a doleful group.
Amputation and death stared its members in their
gloomy faces. Suddenly a voice started softly,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;My country, &rsquo;tis of thee,</p>
<p class="t0">Sweet land of liberty,</p>
<p class="t">Of thee I sing.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Other voices took it up:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Land where my fathers died,</p>
<p class="t0">Land of the pilgrims&rsquo; pride&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The quivering, quavering chorus, punctuated
by groans and made spasmodic by pain, trembled
up from that little group of wounded Americans
in the midst of the Cuban solitude&mdash;the pluckiest,
most heartfelt song that human beings ever sang.
There was one voice that did not quite keep up with
the others. It was so weak that I did not hear it
until all the rest had finished with the line, &lsquo;Let
freedom ring.&rsquo; Then halting, struggling, faint, it
repeated slowly:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Land&mdash;of&mdash;the&mdash;pilgrims&rsquo;&mdash;pride,</p>
<p class="t2">Let&mdash;freedom&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;The last word was a woeful cry. One more son
had died as died the fathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Under different circumstances but in the same
spirit of loyalty the tune of &ldquo;America&rdquo; was played
in France as &ldquo;our boys&rdquo; promptly obeyed the order,</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Salute America!</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Exercises were held on Memorial Day at Menil-la-Tour
when the World War was raging in France.
Two regimental bands took up their positions in
opposite corners of the cemetery. The commanding
general placed a flag on each of the eighty-one
graves. He and the soldiers then saluted the large
flag, while battle was still being waged about a mile
away.</p>
<p>The general then faced the west, and pointed in
that direction as he addressed the soldiers. He said:
&ldquo;Out there are Washington and the President, and
all the people of the United States, who are looking
to you.... Over there are the mothers who bade
you good-bye with tears and sent you forth, and are
waiting at home and praying for you, trusting in
you. Out there are the fathers and the sisters and
the sweethearts you have left behind, all depending
on you to do your best. Now,&rdquo; said he in a clear
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
ringing voice, &ldquo;turn and salute America!&rdquo; All
turned and saluted toward the west, while the
flags fluttered on the breeze and the band played
softly,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;My country, &rsquo;tis of thee,</p>
<p class="t0">Sweet land of liberty,</p>
<p class="t">Of thee I sing:</p>
<p class="t0">Land where my fathers died,</p>
<p class="t0">Land of the pilgrims&rsquo; pride,</p>
<p class="t0">From every mountain side</p>
<p class="t">Let freedom ring.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">A distinction with a difference was clearly evidenced
when Britishers sang a German&rsquo;s hymn,</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Now Thank We All Our God</span>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>I quote from <i>The Christian Advocate</i>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the dedication of the British War memorial
at the Menin Gate of Ypres, where its arch spans
the main street, three great hymns were sung: &lsquo;O
God, Our Help in Ages Past,&rsquo; by Isaac Watts; &lsquo;For
All the Saints Who From Their Labors Rest,&rsquo; by
Bishop How, and &lsquo;Now Thank We All Our God,&rsquo;
which is a translation by Catherine Winkworth
from the German of Martin Rinkart! Time heals
wounds. Who would have believed it, had he been
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
told soon after the Armistice that this hymn&mdash;noble
and beautiful as it is&mdash;would be selected and
sung by British soldiers at the dedication of a
monument erected to the memory of those who fell
in a war against Germans? Yet no one raised a
word of protest or remarked upon any incongruity,
for the instincts of the human heart are deeper than
the traditional and conventional differences which
separate nations.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"><i>The New York Times</i> for August 18, 1929,
had an article, &ldquo;Georgia Lower House Opens Day
with Song.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a> It is interesting to note this reference
to</p>
<h3><span class="sc">A Singing Legislature</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;The Rev. W. D. Hammack, &lsquo;Uncle Billie,&rsquo; has
been the chaplain of the Lower House for several
years. He is a great believer in the power of song.
He likes to &lsquo;raise a tune,&rsquo; and he doesn&rsquo;t care
whether the Governor of Georgia and the Legislature
are at loggerheads or at peace; he thinks a
legislator should be made to sing whether he can
sing or not. So every morning for ten minutes he
lines up the early arrivals just before the House
opens for the day and starts on some of the old-time
religious vocal numbers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;Richard Russell Jr., Speaker of the House,
gives Mr. Hammack carte blanche to lead his flock
of lawmakers just as far in the harmony line as he
can, and &lsquo;Uncle Billie&rsquo; has made good. He pitches
the tune every morning and the House sings. Sometimes
it is &lsquo;Jesus, Lover of My Soul&rsquo; and the next
morning it is &lsquo;Nearer, My God, to Thee.&rsquo; Another
favorite is &lsquo;All Hail the Power of Jesus&rsquo; Name.&rsquo;
Once or twice they have tackled &lsquo;Gimme the Old-Time
Religion&rsquo; with much success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many years ago a philosopher said, &lsquo;Let me
but write the songs of a nation and I care not who
makes its laws.&rsquo; And the Rev. Mr. Hammack, although
he had written none of them, has done a
lot with his songs during the dog days of the legislative
session. Georgia has probably the only singing
legislature in captivity.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">No better song could have expressed the feelings
of our nation, and so it was that we sang</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Doxology on Armistice Day</span></h3>
<p>New York City, in common with other parts of
the United States, was wild with excitement on
Armistice Day, 1918. The fighting was over, and
men, women and children gave expression to their
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
happiness in various ways. City, village and hamlet
alike had some kind of wild demonstration. Seeing
the excited crowd, a young woman, an officer of
the Salvation Army, as reported in the newspapers
at that time, stood on the steps of the great Public
Library in New York and began to sing the old
Doxology. Instantly the crowd took up the strain,
and in a moment, as though by magic, thousands of
voices blended in the noble words of thanksgiving:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;</p>
<p class="t0">Praise Him all creatures here below;</p>
<p class="t0">Praise Him above, ye heavenly host;</p>
<p class="t0">Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Men reverently removed their hats, and the
eyes of women filled with tears. The words of
Thomas Ken that day expressed the gratitude of a
great multitude. Among the many things done
through that entire day, perhaps there was none
more appropriate or beautiful than that which the
Salvation Army lassie did.</p>
<p>And with this reference to the Doxology we conclude
our story of the influence of hymns in the experience
of &ldquo;all peoples that on earth do dwell.&rdquo;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
